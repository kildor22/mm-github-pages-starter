Hey, there, Stranger! You're probably wondering where you are. No worries, just kick back, relax,
and I'll explain in a jiffy. 
</p>
<p>
And no, you're not being held hostage despite being bound and gagged. You can leave by clicking the "X"
button on the upper-right or use the home button of whatever device you're holding right now.

This here vault is a collection of some of the (more presentable) poems and stories I've written thus far.
Some are good and some are okay, though they all share one thing in common: they're embarrassing to
show to the public eye. 
</p>

<p>
However crude they may be, here they are for your viewing pleasure (or displeasure, whichever). 
</p>

<p>
Enjoy your stay and welcome to The Vault.
