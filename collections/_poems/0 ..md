Every human is born with a hole,
<br>

a hole that infests the recesses of a soul,
<br>

empty and hollow, naught but nothing inside,
<br>

a void dark and infinite where emptiness resides,
<br>

Intentionally or unintentionally, by the act of nature or the Divine,
<br>

 a human is born with a hole,
 <br>

this hole takes the pieces apart and fragments the whole,
<br>

perhaps it is to blame for the grief-stricken bastard on his seat,
<br>

with his fingers deadlocked and frozen like sleet,
<br>

he weeps, burdened by the ages of lost hope and grief,
<br>

he searched but to no avail, a means to fill the carcass,
<br>

an abandoned chrysalis with a pen and paper wedged somewhere in, but as--
<br>

much as hope would like to assist,
<br>

he's nothing more but a human being breathing six feet deep, 
<br>

a soul drifting in a sea of ennui, 
<br>

yearning for a sheen of hope in the horizon,
<br>

longing for something that would finally make him as God intended,
<br>

whole.
