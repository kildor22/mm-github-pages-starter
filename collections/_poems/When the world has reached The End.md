When the world has reached The End,
<br>
and I am left alone,
<br>
what would matter then is not the whispers in the empty streets, <br>
or the shadows that dance in the alleyways of my heart, <br>
but the thought of her that lingers, <br>
like a flickering flame in a frigid wonderland, <br>
oh,  <br>
memories of her like sunlight on skin, <br>
seeping through the cracks and reminding me of her warmth, <br>
embracing me with smiles that cling, <br>
like a resilient branch that flails a leaf in the wind,<br>
oh,<br>
i have forgotten,<br>
what it's like in a world so barren,<br>
that echoes her name,<br>
in every bend and crook in the road,
oh,<br>
though faint,<br>
her presence thaws this frozen heart,<br>
and lives on,<br>
ringing in its hollow cavities,<br>
binding itself to the strings and pores,<br>
and as i lay,<br>
myself to rest,<br>
her name is of,<br>
my dying breath,<br>
for she has filled,<br>
an endless void,<br>
that I could never fill on my own.<br>
