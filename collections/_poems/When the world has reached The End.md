When the world has reached The End,
and I am left alone,
what would matter then is not the whispers in the empty streets,
or the shadows that dance in the alleyways of my heart,
but the thought of her that lingers,
like a flickering flame in a frigid wonderland,
oh, 
memories of her like sunlight on skin,
seeping through the cracks and reminding me of her warmth,
embracing me with smiles that cling,
like a resilient branch that flails a leaf in the wind,
oh,
i have forgotten,
what it's like in a world so barren,
that echoes her name,
in every bend and crook in the road,
oh,
though faint,
her presence thaws this frozen heart,
and lives on,
ringing in its hollow cavities,
binding itself to the strings and pores,
and as i lay,
myself to rest,
her name is of,
my dying breath,
for she has filled,
an endless void,
that I could never fill on my own.
