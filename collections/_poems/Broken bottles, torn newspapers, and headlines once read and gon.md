Broken bottles, torn newspapers, and headlines once read and gone lay haphazardly before me. The television is on, static buzzing enveloping the room in black and gray, and gray and black, to compliment the room's walls with its cackling.
<br>
The faint scent of alcohol is reminiscent of his presence. He no longer lives, but his soul lives through the bottles. And it will only take one misstep to awaken him again. 
<br>
Your house is filled with people, who sit on cherished chairs and sleep on groomed beds--whom dine at the table together, feast on the same table with equal portions of food, chomping down with grins as big as yours.
<br>
My home is filled with people, that feels no fuller than a barren one. My people sit on rusted chairs, chewed by the weight of the burdens they carry, and sleep on cobblestone beds that carry the same. We dine at the table -- at most four, at a time -- with rations for every hungry mouth, lest one gets more than the other and the hounds are set free. On my table, we do not grin. On my table, we chastise and mock. We play with feelings and feed on the words, that seem to hurt more bones and break more sticks, and relieve our parched selves with the tears of one another. Ravenously, we dine on emotions. On your table, you feel full. Content. On mine, we remain hungry, no matter how fine the food is.
<br>
Perhaps, the scent of alcohol that has etched itself into these walls is a vague reminder of good memories. But maybe, it may also be the reason why these walls are crumbling; why the air is musty and dry, why the paint seems to chip and why the floorboards have been ravaged by termites.
<br>
Broken bottles, torn newspapers, and reread headlines that mean nothing anymore. 
<br>
Dining tables that feed nobody.
<br>
Your people read the newspaper and throw them into the recycle.\\  
My people read the newspaper and then keep them to read... forever.\\
Your people keep mementos, my people keep bruises and emotions.\\
Your people listen to music, my people hear shouting.\\
Your people feel full, mine feel empty.\\
Your people close their cabinets and turn off the lights at night.\\
My people do not, so they check under the bed and get scared if they see themselves.\\
My people hide under the blankets, and run away from their problems.\\
Your people get together and cry.\\
My people runaway and hide.\\
Your people are vulnerable.\\
My people act invulnerable.\\

You want to stay.\\
I want to get out.\\

I want to get out.\\


I want to get out.\\



I see broken bottles, torn newspapers and the static of the television enveloping the room. I walk up to the eden where I take refuge.\\


And I am all alone. \\

But then I see him, walking downstairs to look for the remote.\\

He changes the channel. He takes out the bottles. He sweeps the newspaper and throws them out. He buys new ones. He asks a question and talks.\\

And everything is diferent.\\
