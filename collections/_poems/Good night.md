When the sun has disappeared beneath the willows, and the wind has found its resting place, tell her good night.

When the windows have finally closed, and the town has shut its doors, tell her good night.

When torch fires have been doused, and the fireflies have come out to play, sit beside her to whisper, "good night".

In bed, when you're merely a breath away, look into her cloying stare and kiss her good night.

But when the time comes and she has forgotten you, and the days seem to fritter with her, tell her good night, one last time.

No matter how hard, say good night, because then at least you'd know you've tried.

And when she tells you "good night"...

sleep.
