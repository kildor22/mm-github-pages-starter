<p>When the sun has disappeared beneath the willows, and the wind has found its resting place, tell her good night.
</p>

<p>
When the windows have finally closed, and the town has shut its doors, tell her good night.
</p>

<p>
When torch fires have been doused, and the fireflies have come out to play, sit beside her to whisper, "good night".
</p>

<p>
In bed, when you're merely a breath away, look into her cloying stare and kiss her good night.
</p>

<p>
But when the time comes and she has forgotten you, and the days seem to fritter with her, tell her good night, one last time.
</p>

<p>
No matter how hard, say good night, because then at least you'd know you've tried.
</p>

<p>
And when she tells you "good night"...
</p>

<p>
sleep.
</p>
