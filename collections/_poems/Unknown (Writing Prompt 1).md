There are a myriad of things to be afraid of.

Knives, dark alleyways, failure, therapy, writing-- a kaleidoscope of fingers that douse the flame on the last match stick, if you will. Fear. Dread. Putrid ideas that form an amalgamation of *"what ifs"* and *"maybe I shouldn't haves*  in your head. It's human nature to fear; no fear is inherently irrational, unless you make it so. So then why, of all things, am I intoxicated by my fear of the dark?

For as long as I've known-- for as long as light has graced my eyes, the lackthereof has always choked me up and forced me to retreat into this imaginary cubbyhole as a coping mechanism. Every night, I fall into slumber and dream of a venture into the woods, beyond the undergrowth where the abyss awaited me.

 A little boy no older than two, in his pyjamas of blond ducks and baby blue, strides fearfully into the unknown where something may or may not have awaited him. 

I crept, wearily, unsure of what was to come as brambles carressed my face in a call to inch closer. Twigs crinkled under my pyjama feet as I followed the whispers in the oak, soft steps thorned by the breaking of virgin wood. The darkness would grow into a looming shadow the more I advanced to the heart of what terrorized my dreams.
When it was finally time-- when the void had decided to cease its impertinent toying of the figure that traversed its woods-- I was faced with the dim glow of red, behind a wall of dead leaves and iron brambles. What was waiting on the other side, I did not know. But this, I know for sure: it breathed.

 It was breathing. The faint glow of red seemed to throb along to the sound of my heartbeat; it died and it glowed, to the pounding of my chest. As I put my hand forward, reaching out to part the iron brambles that obstructed me from this-- this *thing*-- the glow would flare and my eyes would be seared with a pain I did not understand. And then I would awaken to the lullabies, and the warmth of my mother's breast. The darkness would hear me cry into the night, relishing my fear of what was behind that wall. It basked under the moonlight, and danced with my dread for the unknown.

Age has not made me wiser. Time has proved to be relentless with its doses of
harrowing thoughts that seep into my skin. I still get nightmares of that same phantasmagoria-- the woods, the pyjamas, the throbbing-- everything. Although, as all men be blessed, I have been equipped with an understanding of what it may actually be. Often, I look back to the nights I'd peer out of my window, through shattered glasses, as I watched the devil dance with my fear; twirling her in his arms and swaying her hips under a twilit haze. He caroused and merried with her in silent cadence and after every foot forward, would look back at me in mockery. He would bare his teeth. 

What I hadn't realized then, that I do now, is that fear does not have a face. Fear has *no teeth to bare.* At that instant, I closed my eyes and saw the devil dancing with the moonlight. I didn't have a fear to be afraid of-- I wasn't afraid of the dark. What I thought I was afraid of wasn't there, but what led me to cower was the thought of what could have awaited me beyond. If I were to return and plow through the morass of my uncertainty in that macabre dreamscape, the brambles would part and I would find... nothing. The darkness would then feel more like a cold hug than a grip around my neck. I feared to embrace _fear_, and so it feared me in return.

Perhaps, as my worries finally reach a closure, the dreams would stop and these tormented platitudes can now be laid to rest. 

As I gaze outside my window once more, beneath a sky that tuned to the mellows of my heart, I see two shadows in a playful cadenza. Neither the devil nor my fear, but the swaying of the willows beneath the moon.
