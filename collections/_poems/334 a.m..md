<p>I stare, at the vast blanket of darkness that envelops us. Dotted by the cosmos and beyond, we lie still.
</p>

<p>
She looks at me, her irises mirroring the blanket that warms us. They droop, waiting for the utterance of a word; the mutter of a single breath.
</p>

<p>
Chuckling, I raise my palm and hold the night sky.
</p>

<p>
"Do you believe in what lies beyond? That there are worlds like ours among the stars? Galaxies full of life that are hidden from plain view?" I say.
</p>

<p>
She stares at me, wide-eyed. An endless pair of black I've fallen into.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she says with the remnants of her consciousness.
</p>

<p>
I only asked if she was aware.
</p>

<p>
I believe the universe can lose its grip, and that it also falls asleep.
</p>

<p>
Right now, my universe is falling asleep beside me.
