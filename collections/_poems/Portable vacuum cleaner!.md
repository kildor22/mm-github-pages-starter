"Portable vacuum cleaner!" 

The man in the red vest shouts through his microphone. His sales pitch reverbrates through the cold air from the minuscule speaker weakly attached to the sleeve of his belt. 

"Bumili na po kayo! Promo na 50% off para sa pasko!" 

He attempts to smile wryly, with the crack in his voice barely worth a notice by the passers-by. He puts his whole weight over the table-- arrayed with the mechanical, plastic parts of the vacuum cleaner he is desperately trying to sell-- and puts his sweaty palm over a wrinkled forehead. For a moment, if not for the raucous swarms of mall shoppers inching through item displays and tired eyes, the man was falling into a pit of slumber. His back was bent and his uniform crudely out of shape, his stick-like forearms were sprawled carelessly on the red tabletop, ready to break under the weight of his shoulders burdened by a machine small enough to be passable as a toy.

He lets out another call for attention but retreats soon after. He has seen it-- no, heard it, more than enough to know that apathy speaks louder than words and there is no means to go beyond that. He is only a man in a red vest, after all. Just a salesman whose survival for the winter depends on a price-cut vacuum cleaner. Nothing more.
