<p>
I am proud of my tired eyes because beyond these eyelids that act as blinds to the world, are two glimmering beads of pewter that continue to see no matter how fatigued they are. The longer they keep themselves wide open, the more difficult it is too stay awake as the burden forces them shut.
</p>

<p>
But of course, how can you shield them from the suffering outside; from the dilapidated shanties impressed on Philippine soil like a never-healing firebrand? The scars of our past remain as deep cuts, oozing blood that spill onto our people as they stand and do nothing. The wails of children born into squalor echo throughout our islands, pleading us to listen in 7,000 different whispers, often 7,000 times. Yet only one stands between me and them -- the door of my room.
</p>

<p>
You can cover my eyes and tell me to pretend that I do not see anything, but you have not cupped my ears. At the doorstep, I listen to the children playing, their rubber slippers tapping on the concrete like drops of rain on a battered roof. Listen closely and put your ears to the door, because they have much more to say at the other side.
</p>

<p>
It's Juan, the voice of a boy without an education.
</p>

<p>
It's Juan, the voice of a boy born and raised in poverty.
</p>

<p>
It's Juan, who has never owned a toy.
</p>

<p>
It's Juan, who has never known how it truly feels to be a young boy.
</p>

<p>
Listen, the variegated pattering of their feet tell stories of boys and girls who have befriended the streets. They tell tall tales of small ones who do not often eat. They speak of children who do not know how to read.
</p>

<p>
You may have blinded me, and you may try to drown the noise, but my mouth is open and my voice is ready to be heard.
</p>

<p>
So, I ask myself, who is to blame for forsaking them? Who is to blame for choking the people and jailing their voice?
</p>

<p>
Only then, when I closed my eyes and listened did I understand.
