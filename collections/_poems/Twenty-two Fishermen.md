<p>
Twenty-two fishermen went out to sea, <br>
backs weighed by nets and the hopes of their families,  <br>
beneath the beating heat of the sun they cast their nets,  <br>
into waters they owned, supposedly.   <br>
</p>

<p>
Twenty-two fishermen went out to sea,  <br>
"Kailan kayo babalik?" asked the wife of the 21st,  <br>
"Maaga ba kayong uuwi?" asked the mother of the 20th,  <br>
"Mag-ingat po kayo," said the child of the 19th.  <br>
</p>


<p>
Twenty-two fishermen went out to sea,  <br>
wondering when they would ever return,  <br>
or if they may never again see the light of day,  <br>
and the three stars that puncture the night sky,  <br>
acting as beacons that would guide them home.  <br>
</p>


<p>
Twenty-two fishermen went out to sea,  <br>
like nets, they cast their hopes to blue waters,  <br>
surviving day by day,  <br>
so that their children would live for years,  <br>
and their nation, forever,  <br>
even if the catch was scarce.  <br>
</p>


<p>
That day, twenty-two fishermen went out to sea,  <br>
and twenty-two fishermen almost never came back,  <br>
they were left for dead in the bitter jaws of the ocean,  <br>
in the waters where they cast their nets,  <br>
the waters that birthed the blood of their kin,  <br>
the waters of their land,  <br>
the waters they owned,  <br>
<p>
<p>
supposedly.  <br>
</p>


<p>
Twenty-two fishermen reached familiar shores, thankfully,  <br>
returning not with fish but with a thirst for justice, <br>
they put down their nets and pleaded for aid, <br>
like throwing pebbles at a wave, <br>
<p>
<p>
futile. <br>
</p>


<p>
Twenty-two fishermen went out to sea, <br>
and nearly twenty-two lives were lost, <br>
but they knew that if they had died, <br>
another would have joined them,  <br>
</p>


<p>
our sovereignty. <br>
</p>


<p>
Twenty-two fishermen went out to sea, <br>
and twenty-two Filipinos returned to their families, <br>
twenty-two Filipinos who made a living off their ocean, <br>
an ocean they feel they did not own. <br>
</p>


<p>
Twenty-two fishermen were thrown out to sea, <br>
but were saved from the fangs of death -- <br>
by friends who were not their own, <br>
by people who were not their own. <br>
</p>


<p>
And when twenty-two fishermen went out to see, <br>
the faces of their countrymen,  <br>
and the man who pulled the strings, <br>
they felt that they were on shores -- <br>
that were not their own. <br>
