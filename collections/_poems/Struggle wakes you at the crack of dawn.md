Struggle wakes you at the crack of dawn, <br>
listening to your creaking bones,<br>

Struggle is the fight to keep your eyelids open,<br>
heavy, clasped tightly,<br>

Struggle is the shouting of family members,<br>
like roosters that greet the dawn,<br>

Struggle is in your body,<br>
festering like a portion of your flesh meant to rot,<br>

Struggle is planted in your mind,<br>
like a vein that crawls from the cranium,<br>
winding down to the rest of your body,<br>
creeping on bone and soft tissue,<br>
and twining itself with your extremities,<br>

Struggle is the shaking of your fingers as you write,<br>
Struggle is the unbirth of an idea,<br>
Struggle is the ringing in your head,<br>
knocking on your conscience,<br>
knocking at your doorstep,<br>

when struggle is at your door, will you wake to greet it?<br>

perhaps not, and you'll keep the door closed, biding time as it seeps through the cracks.<br>

struggle is your truth, one that knows no doors, <br>

cares not for life, <br>

listens to nobody.<br>


so for today, keep it ajar, and see how you'd face it on the morrow.<br>
