Struggle wakes you at the crack of dawn,
listening to your creaking bones,

Struggle is the fight to keep your eyelids open,
heavy, clasped tightly,

Struggle is the shouting of family members,
like roosters that greet the dawn,

Struggle is in your body,
festering like a portion of your flesh meant to rot,

Struggle is planted in your mind,
like a vein that crawls from the cranium,
winding down to the rest of your body,
creeping on bone and soft tissue,
and twining itself with your extremities,

Struggle is the shaking of your fingers as you write,
Struggle is the unbirth of an idea,
Struggle is the ringing in your head,
knocking on your conscience,
knocking at your doorstep,

when struggle is at your door, will you wake to greet it?

perhaps not, and you'll keep the door closed, biding time as it seeps through the cracks.

struggle is your truth, one that knows no doors, 

cares not for life, 

listens to nobody.


so for today, keep it ajar, and see how you'd face it on the morrow.
