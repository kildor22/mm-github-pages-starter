Tell me, if the winds carry your words to farther shores, will the ocean breeze catch it as a message and store it in a bottle? Will the waves cradle it slowly and lull it in its depths?

Who will listen when your words are sent away by the breeze; ephemeral messages meant for nobody else but you? Perhaps, once it reaches the canopies and wakes the oak with stolen poetry, one will come along to listen to your words that rustle the leaves. And if by chance, they catch it from a falling leaf, then they'd have a part of you-- one you chose to set free.
