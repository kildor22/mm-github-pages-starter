<p>
  How do you know if your words have power?
 </p>
 
 <p>
  Anyone can write-- a man who is down on his luck; who just happens upon an abandoned journal jettisoned to the ocean shore, can sit on the beach and uncap his blue-inked pen to start scribbling on washed-out pages. There is no difference between me and him, but the circumstance at which we wield our pen. Leagues of writers have come before him, doing the same thing he does, though rarely have there been writers true enough to themselves and their readers for their words to hold impalpable power.
</p>

<p>
  A hobbyist can write thousands of pages of stories, words upon words, building upon the works of innovators who precede him. He can scrawl sentences of sheer beauty incessantly, crafting imagery with utmost detail until his pen can no longer feed ink to the paper. Nonetheless, he still may find himself throwing words into a bottomless void as he captivates nobody.
</p>

<p>
  Rarely have there been writers who have weaved words to a caliber much higher than their own being; more tangible than the objects that surround the reader as he reads.
</p>

<p>
  For time has birthed countless of good writers, and only a few have been honest-- it is what distinguishes the good from the great.
</p>

<p>
  A writer's words will only be as good as the writer himself, and the power of words can only be drawn out when the writing is at its most vulnerable, allowing the reader to grasp and feel its curves and edges; secrets only their whispers can carry.
</p>

<p>
  It is vulnerable not when your readers are brought to tears, but when you, the writer, weep as you pen the sentences. Every word that embraces the page is a reflection of you at your weakest.
</p>

<p>
  So draw it out, be honest, and let the tears soak your garden of budding words.
