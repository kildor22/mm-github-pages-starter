<p>
Is this poetry?
</p>

<p>
It is poetry.
</p>

<p>
Poetry doesn't have to be beautiful; just has to mean something with its words.
</p>

<p>
Poetry isn't like people, and
</p>

<p>
Poetry doesn't like people.
</p>

<p>
Poetry isn't boastful and ominous like a steeple,
</p>

<p>
Poetry's shy and pragmatic,
</p>

<p>
she doesn't like to talk about herself and it's already difficult to see through her as is,
</p>

<p>
like watching TV with static,
</p>

<p>
Poetry's a person who is probably problematic,
</p>

<p>
she always has something to write about,
</p>

<p>
always has something that should be said out loud,
</p>

<p>
although she keeps it enshrouded,
</p>

<p>
hidden beneath allegories and metaphors that leave me dumbfounded,
</p>

<p>
she says that I'm poetry in all shapes and sizes, and the words she wants to hear me say are always clouded,
</p>

<p>
but that's not true, she herself is never straightforward about it,
</p>

<p>
Poetry hides her feelings behind confounded walls of text, out of context,
</p>

<p>
which honestly vexes me, but it's not as bad as it seems,
</p>

<p>
because I beam whenever I sew the seams, 
</p>

<p>
the lines and wrinkles that make up her poetic tee,
</p>

<p>
a reminder that she has dreams,
</p>

<p>
and Poetry doesn't just dream at night because I know that she daydreams,
</p>

<p>
about the words she'd be willing to write for me,
</p>

<p>
the words she'd scribble on her palm that she'd keep until faded, forever unseen
</p>

<p>
the words that are dying to be engorged by eyes like superfluous stew more often,
</p>

<p>
at times I wish I could uncurl Poetry's palms and expose them to the open,
</p>

<p>
five fingers up to the vermillion skies, grasping the world with fingertips that have held thousands of pens, homed the ink of a million colors and written more words than there are blinking lights in the universe,
</p>

<p>
I wish Poetry would be more open.
</p>

<p>
I wish I could understand all the allegories, and the metaphors, and the contexts, and strings of words that make no sense--
</p>

<p>
at least to me.
</p>

<p>
Because I'm not poetic.
</p>

<p>
I'm not the perfect poet who'd write the words she'd want to hear.
</p>

<p>
I'm not the heartfelt letter that would bring a smile to her face, after re-reading decades later,
</p>

<p>
Not the beloved books she would read countless of times,
</p>

<p>
not every line that would comprise her poetic life.
</p>
 
 <p>
but I write,
</p>

<p>
because I love Poetry, still.
</p>
