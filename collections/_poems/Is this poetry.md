Is this poetry?

It is poetry.

Poetry doesn't have to be beautiful; just has to mean something with its words.

Poetry isn't like people, and

Poetry doesn't like people.

Poetry isn't boastful and ominous like a steeple,

Poetry's shy and pragmatic,

she doesn't like to talk about herself and it's already difficult to see through her as is,

like watching TV with static,

Poetry's a person who is probably problematic,

she always has something to write about,

always has something that should be said out loud,

although she keeps it enshrouded,

hidden beneath allegories and metaphors that leave me dumbfounded,

she says that I'm poetry in all shapes and sizes, and the words she wants to hear me say are always clouded,

but that's not true, she herself is never straightforward about it,

Poetry hides her feelings behind confounded walls of text, out of context,

which honestly vexes me, but it's not as bad as it seems,

because I beam whenever I sew the seams, 

the lines and wrinkles that make up her poetic tee,

a reminder that she has dreams,

and Poetry doesn't just dream at night because I know that she daydreams,

about the words she'd be willing to write for me,

the words she'd scribble on her palm that she'd keep until faded, forever unseen

the words that are dying to be engorged by eyes like superfluous stew more often,

at times I wish I could uncurl Poetry's palms and expose them to the open,

five fingers up to the vermillion skies, grasping the world with fingertips that have held thousands of pens, homed the ink of a million colors and written more words than there are blinking lights in the universe,


I wish Poetry would be more open.

I wish I could understand all the allegories, and the metaphors, and the contexts, and strings of words that make no sense--

at least to me.

Because I'm not poetic.

I'm not the perfect poet who'd write the words she'd want to hear.

I'm not the heartfelt letter that would bring a smile to her face, after re-reading decades later,

Not the beloved books she would read countless of times,

not every line that would comprise her poetic life.
 
but I write,

because I love Poetry, still.
