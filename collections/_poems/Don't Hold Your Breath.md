I'm sorry, brain, I can't sleep. My mind is awash with thoughts about the future. They leave a mark on you  like a thin sheet of condensed breath. Except thst they are from breaths I have not even taken yet.

Sometimes, I wish to stop breathing.

 Just this once, so that I can rest and see through the crystalline glass of what's about to be, and all that will ever be, instead of peering into the fog and seeing nothing but a vague glint; the outline of a pair of blank eyes staring right back at me.

Maybe then, I would see with utmost clarity.

Here I go.

I'll hold my breath.
