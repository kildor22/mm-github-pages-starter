<p>
I am a toy made of clock work parts. The toymaker says I'll expire soon though I find it difficult to believe. I have only been active for approximately 332 days-- 126 of which was spent in a lonely cardboard box that barely had any room for my clockwork arms. This, I know, because I kept count of the number of days through the incessant ticking in my head. Two ticks per second, a hundred twenty a minute; 162,800 for a full sun cycle. I'm one of those action figures that are not powered by batteries. Twist the knob on my back and watch me move my legs to the sound of a drum beat. A clockwork drummer boy being sold all-year round; no wonder I didn't sell until day 253! No one buys boys like me under the summer heat. I'm afraid I would melt and my paint would corrode.
</p>

<p>
Alas, it's difficult to feel when you're made of cogs, moving in definite directions, staring through the same old plastic casing at the world that couldn't care less about whether you're disposed of the next day. I suppose I just wasn't made for a big playground. Kids would gawk and point at me with their stubby fingers through the display glass, breathing heavily and leaving it all fogged up. As soon as they go, I feel lonely and wonder what it's like to not be a plaything. 
</p>

<p>
During Christmas season, I feel special. But like the sleet that paves the roads in white, the emotion is fleeting. Besides that, like snow, I was never meant to feel it-- to feel like I mean something.
</p>

<p>
I am made of clockwork and proof of it is the ticking you'd hear as I give the drum a beat. You can point and make merry, aweing the shiny buttons on my red coat. 
</p>

<p>
But I suppose I'm more broken than my shell would want others to see.
</p>

<p>
Though I am a toy, I feel rigidity in my limbs. They are like the malleable metal strings that chain me to the cardboard box I was once cased in.
</p>

<p>
For once, I would like to know how it feels like to be out of the box-- to discern my own value before the store clerk sticks a price tag on my head. I don't need to be loved by others. What I want is to see my reflection on the display mirror and say,  "I'm not clockwork!" 
</p>

<p>
I want to love myself before others do it for me, before the smiles of anyone would make me feel special. I want to know how it feels to smile, even if it is a mechanical one.
</p>

<p>
Yes, I am made of mechanical parts; of a clockwork mind that solely defines clockwork movements. But more than that, I am an innovative toy-- one that seeks to go beyond its manufactured functions.
</p>

<p>
I know how to love and see what I'm worth-- I don't think any other toy can do that.
