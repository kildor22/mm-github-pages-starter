How can you say that we're out of time,
when the clock has barely struck midnight?

Let it tick and tock, love,
let its gears and clockwork wind,
for our love is beyond the numbers that hang on the wall,

and no matter how much you try,
you can never etch it in stone,
for love is an uncountable noun,
and mine is perpetually infinite.
