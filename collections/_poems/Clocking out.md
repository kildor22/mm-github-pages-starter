How can you say that we're out of time, 
<br>
when the clock has barely struck midnight?
 <br>

Let it tick and tock, love, 
<br>
let its gears and clockwork wind, 
<br>
for our love is beyond the numbers that hang on the wall,

and no matter how much you try, 
<br>
you can never etch it in stone, 
<br>
for love is an uncountable noun, 
<br>
and mine is perpetually infinite. 
<br>
