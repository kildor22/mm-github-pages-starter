There it is at your fingertips, the opportunity you've been looking for. Seize it, grab it, hold it and never let go -- tell yourself you cannot breathe without it. The door is open and all you have to do is walk out, feel the warmth of the sun embracing your skin, then speak. 

Shout, speak, sputter... make your audience listen. Speak till the muscles in your neck constrict your voice, and if ever they do, tear them away and let your speech flow like the blood welling up in your mouth. Have them tremble in their seats as your voice booms like the crack of a bell, pouring your soul into every word; spelling out the fruit of your passion with every letter. You've taken this moment in mid-air as it fell, like a feather idly floating in the sky, and this is the first of your wings.

 Fly high, as if the sun doesn't exist, and never be afraid to crash and burn.
