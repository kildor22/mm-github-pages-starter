<p>
I was once a ruler of my own castle. 

</p>

<p>
To me, the sound of music would be the clacking of dancing shoes on its cobblestone floors, and the raucous cheering of my townsmen would provide the melody. I would sit on my throne with a smile plastered on my face –one I thought permanent. I would not partake with the merriment as I would merely observe but that alone has given me great gratification all this time. The crown on my head would slip and a maiden would come to re-adjust it on my curls, making sure to get the tilt right. Knaves would offer wine and a whole rack of lamb as a toast to the king and the hallow halls of his fort. In front of me they would dance, and behind them I would indulge in their joy. This was all true until the light slithered from my grasp and the castle was engulfed in the darkness, with me in the throne still.
 </p>
  
 <p>
  I was left alone.
 </p>
 
 <p>
  My castle, once full of raucous laughter is now a hollow shell of their remembrance. I sit motionless on my throne, forcing a grin, perhaps, a flick of the corners of my mouth, but all that comes out is an arid heaving of air. My castle is empty, and so am I. In it, I tried to find the laughter, the carousing and the qualities I thought were unique to it. Panel by panel, brick by brick, I tear my castle down to the very last stone to find the happiness I crave, to find the smile I so depend on. I am nothing without my subordinates. I am nothing without my people. I am nothing without a smile on my throne. So, in desperation I made a deep cut in my skin and checked to see if I could find whatever I was looking for. I bled, and I bled, and I bled. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
  The burning sensation on my skin made me grit my teeth but I felt in touch with the light, as if for a second – but no. There was nothing there. My knees were soaked in blood. Slivers of red seeped through the wooden paneling below my feet. I let out a sharp cry to beg for a response, but nothing was there. I am all alone, on my throne, once more. And as I looked around me, I cried.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  My castle is no more.
