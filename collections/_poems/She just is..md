<p>
I have scrutinised the details of her face, or imprinted them on my mind, to put it in better words.
</p>

<p>
I have observed how her eyes look-- her steely gaze whenever she is fixated on a certain task or object. A pair of pewter beads gifted with the power to consign other objects to oblivion; portals, which gravitate anything that stare back at it, that draw you in closer and closer. Her eyes droop, stoic and calm, but oddly alive. The dark irises look dead, simple as that, yet are enshrouded in enigma. Whenever she returns the favor and looks at me, they hit with a hitman's precision but are vague enough to confuse and confuzzle-- making me wonder if she is silently judging my facade, or observing the details of my own gaze.
</p>

<p>
I have made a mental note to not look at them often; there is a risk of me falling deep and having trouble swimming to the surface.
</p>

<p>
It is now indelible to me, the way light seems to bounce off of her milky-white skin sheened by a pale yellow tinge; even the faintest glimmers and rays do justice. Her layers complement her cream-dream, vanilla scent perfectly. 
</p>

<p>
Perhaps it reminds me of lavender, or a field of lavenders.
</p>

<p>
I don't know why she smells like that-- I cannot fathom how one person *can*  emanate a scent like that, but she does, and it bothers me, though it is neither unpleasant nor off-putting. Quite the opposite.
</p>

<p>
It's distracting whenever she passes by and I get a whiff of what's familiar, or whenever I sit beside her and it hits me.
 </p>

<p>
I imagine it as a maze of green and lavenders.
</p>

<p>
It's a terrible decision to enter and forego the knowledge you have of any means of egressing, but I enter anyway.  
Compelled, yet doubtful.
 </p>

<p>
Like a little boy with his mouth agape at the entrance of a massive lavender labyrinth, I inch forward; slowly progressing through, until the lavender scent implores me, coaxes me, to loosen up and drop my guard. Then I start to walk at a medium pace, then I jog; then run, until I open my eyes and realise I'm sprinting at full speed.
 </p>

<p>
I bulldoze through the lavender hedges as a pitiful attempt at escaping, while grazing and cutting my skin on the thornbushes as I drag some of the undergrowth with me; the savory, purple wisps numb my senses and ability to feel pain. Upon reaching the exit, I surprise myself.
 </p>

<p>
Empty space-- that is all that is there.
 </p>

<p>
Hell, there is no ground or anything. My feet feel weird. There is no grass floor or a bed of lavender flowers, only nothingness. 
 </p>

<p>
And then I realise that I'm floating, in a sea of lavenders scent, with a faint hint of lead, papers, and angst.
 </p>
  
  <p>
I open my eyes once more and find myself sitting in front of her still, cheek resting on  hand, watching her do whatever she's doing. Again, something that involves her hands or fingers.
 I have burnt her details on the flesh of my brain like a firebrand; although I still have difficulty drawing them. It's difficult to embellish on paper or to put into words: where her straight-cut hair part ways and     how her nose curves. How her lips slightly curl and twitch whenever she makes a                           mistake (with whatever she's doing) and whenever she gets it right. Or how cute    her cheeks look, when they're slightly puffed whenever she sighs because she          made a slight error (with whatever she's doing), and how the purple and green                   veins that branch out beneath her cheeks' translucent, milky-white skin say,             "hello!" to greet the world.                                         
In short, she is poetry in all sizes, shapes, and forms.          
 </p>
  
  <p>   
She just has to be, indubitably.           
 </p>

<p>
There is no need for explanation.     
 </p>
 
 <p>             
Because she just is.
  </p>
