<p>
How can I convince myself that I'm not crazy when every day I stop by a park bench to visit a robot?
</p>

<p>
Everyday, I return to her with a pocket full of pennies, and insert them into a slot on the side of her head like a fat kid fiddling with the gumball machine at a candy store. You see, it's awkward to talk about -- or even to think about, really -- but it's not easy to explain to anybody that you have a crush, much less when you're infatuated with a machine. 
</p>

<p>
How do I know she's a robot, you ask? 
</p>

<p>
Well, apart from the incessant clockwork ticking you'd hear whenever you'd sit beside her, she'd scowl at you for calling that shiny pebble on the sidewalk a rock, when it is in fact, a mineral. 
</p>

<p>
Last Tuesday, she caught a glimpse of a strand of white hair on my head, and proceeded to pluck every single one she could find. All one hundred and seventy-two strands. I'd know. She counted.
</p>

<p>
And if needed be, she'd argue with you about the difference between a chemical imbalance in the brain and love -- and to her, the difference is none.
</p>

<p>
To her, love is a series of numbers, a string of code that's hardwired into the human mind even if it doesn't make any sense. 
</p>

<p>
To her, love is a strongbox whose key was thrown into the ocean; one that she can never retrieve because robots can't swim. 
</p>

<p>
To her, love is binary, zeroes and ones, black and white, with no in-between. 
</p>

<p>
And I must be crazy, or stupid, or crazy, or stupid, or both... because I told her that I loved her anyway.
</p>

<p>
It didn't matter that I'd walk all the way home after seeing her because I had spent all the coins I had for a jeepney ride. And it didn't matter if I was getting baldspots.
</p>

<p>
Because every day was me and a pocket full of loose change waiting to be spent for five minutes of conversation. 
300 seconds of laughter. Moments of hushed giggles and sweet whispers too odd for anyone else to understand.
</p>

<p>
Every day was me, yearning for her, carrying in my pockets a lifetime I was looking to spend.
</p>

<p>
But even then she was worried because she'd hurt me. She knew that robots weren't meant to love, and yet, somehow, the emotion was gnawing at her from the inside. The mechanical ticking I'd hear was the beating of her heart, telling me that she felt the same but she was scared. In a world full of people, why choose to be with a cracked shell of broken parts? Why insist on spending time and spare change for a girl who is entangled in an endless string of bad luck?
</p>

<p>
As a machine, she felt temporary, like a fading plaything that better remained disposable and unwanted; left alone on that musty, two-person park bench. Her biggest fear was not the rust that would plague her skin one day, but the thought of me not being there anymore to see it.
</p>

<p>
Because whenever she'd hurt me, even unintentionally, she'd tell me that I was better off looking for someone better; not a broken toy who would crumble at the slightest touch.
</p>

<p>
But you see, I don't want anyone better. I want her. How can anyone be better when I don't stutter when I talk to her? 
</p>

<p>
Nowadays, I don't bother trying to make sense of our love because it's very much like poetry. At times, it doesn't have to make sense, it just has to mean something.
</p>

<p>
And it didn't matter that her love was locked in a strongbox because I could always save every penny to buy a spare key.
</p>

<p>
It was never about loving a robot, or *loving* and *robot*, it was about love.
</p>

<p>
And love was our language lost in translation between a person and a person who felt like a machine. And yes, she could keep herself wrapped in her metallic case, winding her cogs back and tightening the screws that keep her from embracing the warmth that she so deserves. 
</p>

<p>
She thinks she's a robot, but you see, in a world full of people, she felt the most human to me.
</p>

<p>
And if I'm crazy, I don't want to be sane.
</p>
