<p>It gets cold down here. 
</p>


<p>
You'd think someone like me would get used to it, but no-- winter knocks on the dome of my igloo like an all-too-familar friend who stops by for a cup of cocoa. And having a home made of ice isn't really the most effective way of keeping him out, no matter how much I try. 
</p>


<p>
I don't really like seeing his face, all cold and christmas-cheery; looking as if he has something to celebrate with his red hat on and boots clasped with bells that jingle like an ornamental bear trap gnawing on his ankles. Well! If I could, I'd gladly kick him out onto my front porch--well, whatever's left of it-- and show him the nearest icecap a few hops away to Santa's workshop where all the poor saps belong because winter is a lie.
</p>



<p>It's never like the way they show it on TV,
with people carousing and merrying, being all warm and fuzzy under their snow-white fur coats acting like the world isn't on the brink of collapsing onto itself-- The whiff of gingerbread inching every cobbled corner wraps fortunate lovers who happen to pass by making ado, as they walk hand-in-hand, smile from ear-to-ear and love lip-to-lip. They skirt crooked houses and chimneys lit aglow with the sound of home, fostering every frosted breath with the cachinnation of many more Christmases to come. But the thing is, it's all wrapped in an idyllic box not everyone can receive. The gingerbread isn't gingerbread, concrete supersedes cobblestone and not all houses have chimneys anymore.
</p>


<p>
The warm cup of cocoa sitting lonely atop the table isn't any warmer just by "being" there, without anyone to take a sip. Lest you leave it there to feel the cold grasp of winter, forever colder than the temperature of the room it is in. There's no use making a cup of cocoa without a friend to sip it with you.
</p>


<p>
That's it. People engorge the thought of wrapping themselves into colorful presents that they forget the ones who should receive.They lose sight of the star on top of the tree amidst the scintillating baubles and bows beneath.
</p>


<p>
Because up here, the reality is as clear, and cold as ice.
</p>


<p>
I don't see lovers, I see couples enamored with themselves as others carol for spare change;
</p>


<p>
I don't see houses, only closed doors as the next kid steps up to be turned down and shooed away.
</p>


<p>
I don't smell gingerbread, I sense the longing of a little girl for a bite of holiday goodness outside the bakery store.
</p>


<p>
I don't hear Christmas cheer, only apathy so loud you could here it from one closed door to the next, from one broken hearted caroller to the next; from one homeless soul to the next.
</p>


<p>
I don't see christmas trees stocked with hand-wrapped gifts and a warm fireplace to snuggle by--
</p>


<p>
only people who long for such things.
</p>


<p>
And somehow, we never see the barren streets from the highest point of the gift pile among the trinkets, baubles and berries.
</p>


<p>
Maybe if Santa wasn't so selfish he'd also give gifts to those who don't have a chimney and a roof to sleep under.
</p>


<p>
Maybe then Winter won't be so cold.
</p>


<p>
Maybe then I wouldn't have to kick winter out and trap myself in.
</p>


<p>
But I'm just a penguin, what do I know?
