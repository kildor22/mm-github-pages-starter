<p>
Do you ever feel like you're drifting in the Bootes Void?
</p>

<p>
What is the Bootes Void, you asked? Well, stranger, good thing you did. The Bootes Void is only the largest, emptiest expanse in the known-universe. Millions and millions and millions of miles stretching nowhere. Nothingness. A void of loneliness-- a place so empty you can hear your own thoughts speak to you. A place so empty it may just co.ntend with you for first place.
</p>


<p>
And so, you float in the Bootes Void, wandering aimlessly in the darkness with your extremities splayed; grasping at specks that seem like stars from afar, but are actually just figments of your imagination toying with you because they know how much you yearn for company, or for that void to be filled, who knows? 
</p>

<p>
For as long as you've had your eyes wide open, all you've done is talk to yourself-- scribing star maps in your head, writing stories of exoplanets and destroyed civilizations that will never be read by anybody. 
</p>

<p>
With your hands, you clasp at the darkness, eyes closed, heart hopeful; thinking that somewhere out there, beyond the blanket of black that enshrouds you, there is a beating heart that calls out.
</p>

<p>
 A dying star, a fleeting comet, or humanity's last capsule that's playing a song just for you to hear. 
 </p>
 
 <p>
 The thought of them existing out there with you fills you with a warmth that kindles the light in the dark... for a second.
