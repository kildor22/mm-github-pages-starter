<p>
The pattering of rain is endless on its battered, concrete walls. It heaves a groan that reverbrates through its halls; wondering when the clouds would cease their unrelenting downpour on its weathered facade.
In the end, it thought: none of it really mattered.
</p>

<p>
For too long has its doors been unopened, its windows stained and gray with every room reeking the stench of moss, unkempt beds and food which have decayed--
the wind blows through its corridors where the journey halts in every room and corner bend. Its foundations shake and groan for the lamplights at night that never stayed.
</p>

<p>
What is the use of a beautiful coat of paint on a building unkept and unwanted? The rain, could be its first, would soon be the last, and yet it would be all the same--
</p>

<p>
its walls could be weathered, old and gray, for which no one has recoated and maintained--
the building could keep on standing and yearning in the rain,
</p>

<p>
perpetually rooted in one place waiting, watching for a return that may never be-
</p>

<p>
and yet it has no one to blame.
</p>
