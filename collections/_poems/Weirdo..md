<p> When I was a kid, I didn't know who I was. </p>

<p>
  For sure, though, I was very imaginative. Ripped cloths in the fabric of my mind sew memories of a child who would wear costumes of superheroes, pretending that he was someone important in a world of indifference. 
</p>

<p>
  In third grade, I would write stories inspired by the fables of dragons and knights because life was too boring to write about. I didn't really have much friends in class because I was that one weird kid who played video games and read books. The two are a deadly combination. And by deadly, I meant thrown-in-a-locker-by-bullies-because-you're-a-geek, deadly.
</p> 

<p>
  This "imagination" of mine, be it curse or blessing, has followed me unceasingly like a shadow. It was a curse, so I thought, until one day I had imagined the most dastardly of things -- I started. To like. A girl.
</p> 

<p>
  This was a daunting revelation, for you see, I genuinely thought I was imagining her. "Someone was actually like me!" I'd exclaim, because she's the only one who gets the fucked up humor. And get this: she would write about things too that consequently would ostracize her from the general, normal population of school. Finally, there was someone as lame as I was, and she seemed to be a figment of my imagination.
</p> 

<p>
  Our first date was a weird one out of many-- I took her birdwatching just to scream at the pidgeons because in my mind they looked like velociraptors, and afterwards, we ate fried quail eggs to spite the bird community.
</p> 

<p>
  In the weekends, I'd talk to her about how ugly deep sea creatures are. She then faced me and called me a deep sea creature.
</p> 

<p>
  Whenever we'd go home, we'd walk through the park and pass by the old hobo who would sit on the park bench just to scream at the pidgeons. We then would scream at the pidgeons with him, because why not, and then laugh at him for being crazy because he was screaming at pidgeons.
</p> 

<p>
  And on days when we're bored, we'd watch paint dry-- but forget the anecdotes because the point here is that love is weird. I never really grasped love, I only understood her well. I understood her enough to do what she does best but I could never really encapsulate the concept in my head.
</p> 

<p>
  Love is weird because out of its will, I've donned a costume that I thought would save her. It wasn't just my imagination anymore-- it was the imagination of a costume from the imagination of a love for the imagination of a love I thought I could protect. I'd don a costume to tell her everything was fine even if they weren't. I'd pen stories about her because my imagination and the thought of her are indistinguishable.
</p> 

<p>
  I didn't know I was imagining love.
</p> 

<p>
And at times, I felt that I was imagining love.
</p> 

<p>
  Lately, she hasn't been screaming at the pidgeons with me. She'd walk past them and they'd flutter away.
</p> 

<p>
  Talking on the weekends would die down because she was tired, apparently.
</p> 

<p>
  We stopped looking at the wall because the paint had dried.
</p> 

<p>
  Now, looking at her feels like staring at a mirror and not seeing your reflection.
</p> 

<p>
  The costume doesn't make me feel strong anymore. I've been wearing it for so long, I've forgotten that I was human on the inside. 
</p> 

<p>
  And then hits me, that her weirdness wasn't the appeal. It was by being with her that gave sense to everything.
</p> 
 

<p>
  I have a strong imagination but I know, for sure, that my love for her is real.
</p> 

<p>
 And I know it's real because it hurts.
</p> 

<p>
 At the end of the day, I go up to my room.
</p> 

<p>
 I shut the door and hang the costume to dry. 
</p> 

<p>
 I uncap the pen.
</p> 

<p>
 I write about how real she is to me.
