<p>
Do you know, <br>
why the stars align? <br>
do you know, <br>
how they do? <br>
</p>

<p>
ask then, <br>
approach, <br> 
the nine divines, <br> 
and hear them twinkle, <br>
for me and you. <br>
</p>

<p>
They say, <br>
the stars are empty, <br>
too far for anyone to grasp, <br>
they would make, <br>
the common man fearful, <br>
and any fair maiden abashed. <br>
</p>

<p>
Fret not, <br>
for I think not, <br>
and spread my hands to the sky, <br>
five fingers splayed in the dark. <br>
hopes thrown at a boundless canvas, <br>
</p>


<p>
For I know, <br>
that the stars are hard to grasp, <br>
but for you, <br>
my dear, <br>
anything, <br>
anything for a love that would last. <br>
<p>
