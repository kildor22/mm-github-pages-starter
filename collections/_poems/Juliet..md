What do you pray to the Heavens at night just right before you lie to rest in a mattress worn and depressed that follows the crumbling, decrepit shape of your home? 

What do you mutter, as a prayer, under your breath, every day as you suffer a mechanical existence-- as someone old and frail-- waiting for the timely arrival of death knocking at the rusted door?

Do you pray and say that you are tired? Do you pray and wish the monster inside you be expelled from what was once a pure and driven soul knowing that its presence, long after time, has corrupted it to the core and left it bent and shaken? 

Do you pray to keep fighting? Even if knowing that the fight is a lost cause?

You know it is a lost cause. You have known since the day you felt it creep on you. Time is catching up and you are not an exception to its rules. You smell the stench of death. You feel it festering in your body. Every. Single. Day.

And yet you still fight.

You fight, every day. You, a childless martyr who has taken in the child of others for you are a mother in your own rite.

You fight every day, with the ache in your body fighting against every challenging step, every road block, every dish to wash, every walk in the ever-merciless rain--

you fight.

You fight, with a smile.

The rigid signs of age fade on a face of a warrior who smiles amid the cruel reality of death.

What's more is that you fight for me.

Tirelessly.

You fight for him, you fight for her, and gain nothing in return.

Do the angels know you suffer?
Do they hear your prayers?
Do they know of your monsters?
Do they hear my name as you whisper it before you sleep?

Does the world know you suffer?


Well, I do.


I see you, everyday, waking in tired groans, yet never complaining.

I see you, stooped from ages of providing unconditional love for others, as you wash our dishes with unnerving silence.

As you accompany me in every journey with unwavering support.

No matter how difficult.

The world may not know you suffer,

the angels may not hear your prayers,


but I do.


And you, my love, deserve to be heard.
