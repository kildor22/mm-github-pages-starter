<p>
Last night, I dreamt that I spoke to the Writer's Muse -- the fabled minstrel of all poets. There 
she stood in all her beauty, behind the cascading sheets of her waterfall that gleamed silver in the
moonlight. For a moment, I stood still in the middle of the meadow, awe-struck by the foliage that encorached me;
it was dense enough to nearly swallow my feet.

She beckoned me to approach her, waving a finger to fold her silver waters like a curtain. 

"Come," she said, "perch your lips upon mine and I will breathe life into your ceaseless scrawls".

Who could this enchantress be? To twist my mind and cast a spell upon me... surely this must be some trickery!

While I stood, pondering, my legs began to quiver. As if compelled to follow her whim, my feet shuffled through the grass,
trailing clumps of dirt and dandelion seeds until I felt the coolness of springwater beneath my sole.

She chuckled and said, "you;re mine now."

So I slapped the wench.

No such muse exists.
