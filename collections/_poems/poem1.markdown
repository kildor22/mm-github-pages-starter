<p>
Last night, I dreamt that I spoke to the Writer's Muse -- the fabled minstrel of all poets. There 
she stood in all her beauty, behind the cascading sheets of a waterfall that gleamed silver in the
moonlight. For a moment, I stood still in the middle of the meadow, awe-struck by the foliage that encroached me;
it was dense enough to nearly swallow my feet.
</p>

<p>
She beckoned me to approach her, waving a finger to fold her silver waters like a curtain. 
</p>

<p>
"Come," she said, "perch your lips upon mine and I will breathe life into your ceaseless scrawls".
</p>

<p>
Who could this enchantress be? To twist my mind and cast a spell upon me... surely this must be some trickery!
</p>

<p>
While I stood, pondering, my legs began to quiver. As if compelled to follow her whim, my feet shuffled through the grass,
trailing clumps of dirt and dandelion seeds until I felt the coolness of springwater beneath my sole.
</p>

<p>
She chuckled and said, "you're mine now."
</p>

<p>
So I slapped the wench.
</p>

<p>
No such muse exists.
