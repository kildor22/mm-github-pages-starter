<p>
Imagine what would happen to the stories I have floating around in my mind if I were to die. What then of them? Like precious metals, they would soon melt to nothing once they are fed to the incinerator of life, the jaws of death, the "end-all-be-all" of things.
</p>

<p>
But unlike metals, these stories have power. Unimaginable power. Power that only one who can read between the lines can ever discover.
</p>

<p>
Then again, this would only be harnessed if I were to write them down. Else, they would be forever gone; bought by Death in an antique shop, kept as a trinket that he would hang on his belt, among a myriad of others. He would grin, devilishly, knowing he has kept them from the world and he, in essence, has kept //me// from everyone. From living on, telling stories, and living through word of mouth. 
</p>

<p>
But I shall not falter. I will write them down unceasingly, because my head is a pop-up book of stories waiting to be unfolded; my creativity, the pages, yearning to be unfurled. And as my readers would flip to the very next, and to the very next, they would stare a wondrous stare, as these stories not only capture them, but touch them. 
</p>

<p>
Because my mind is a pop-up book, and I want my stories to stand out. The world is a library of stories with parts unknown, with shelves too high and columns too long to traverse. But if I were to just write down one more word, one more sentence, just an inkblot of a difference, then perhaps the castles in my book would be towering, large enough to be distinguished in this massive library. 
</p>

<p>
And maybe, just maybe, if I inspire at least one soul, who would be coming back for more, then I would live on.
</p>

<p>
Not just through my pop-up book, but also in the books of others. In the stories of others. Perhaps, my name would appear on the first page, as a dedication to the stories I have imparted to the world.
</p>

<p>
Right now, I know, my pop-up book is rough around the edges -- the props barely spring when you unfold the page.  But still, I would like for you to be the first one to read it.
</p>

<p>
The pop-up book before it ever was.
</p>

<p>
Just me and the stories in my head.
