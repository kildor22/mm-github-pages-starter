I was a boy, once frail. Once, I stood in my mother's backyard, where the wind blew on hung blankets and white sheets, carrying their rose and lavender scent. And there, I stood behind my mother as she clipped our clothes to dry, listening to the susurrous rustling in the grass. Before, I thought I could brave it all; standing strong as my cape flapped wildly behind me. But as soon as the wind came and gone, I was on my knees, finding myself bent like the thin trees that shrivel in a storm. 
</p>

<p>
  Though I was molded like them -- with branches that crooked and wound around each other, creeping along the body all the way to the very roots -- we were very much not alike. For the difference between me and a crooked tree, is the ability to get back up.
</p>

<p>
  This is where people are mistaken, you see, for their words cut deeper than any axe that can fall a tree. But once they pierce flesh, their blades would barely make a thud on the bones that keep me rooted. They swing and slice at me, blows striking my bark and the jugular, yet they can never fall me, for my feet dig deeper beneath the Earth-- deeper than the wooden veins that crawl through the soil. Seeking my source of power would mean to pound and claw at my chest, ripping through my malleable armor of muscles sinew by sinew, until you reach the cage that guards my heart. There, my very resolve is seeded.
</p>

  My grandfather was a gardener, and though he tended to a myriad of sunflowers, daisies and posies, I was the lone masterpiece in his garden. He planted me in a soil that was most warm and most caring, fed by a smile that was grossly incandescent, until I sprouted my leaves and bloomed. But to be beautiful was not why he grew me, he said. Anyone can be beautiful, proven by the colors in his kaleidoscope of a garden. But not all flowers can withstand roaring winds, and possess the courage to bend back into shape after their passing. From the very day that he instilled that in me, I have fallen, a great many times. 
</p>

<p>
Because to fall once more, would mean to stand back up. 
</p>


<p>
  And I have, a great many times.
</p>

<p>
  So do not wonder, if ever you were to see me standing in my mother's backyard, arms akimbo as the wind gustles the cape around my neck.  Take no pity if I fall. For you would find me quickly scrambling to my feet afterwards, challenging the wind once more. 
</p>

<p>
  All the while my mother smiles from behind washed sheets, and my grandfather cheering me on from his garden.
