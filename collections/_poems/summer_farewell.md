<p> 
for the rain has started to soak the streets,
<br>

and clouds have curtained the sun,
<br>

summer, I bid you farewell, 
<br>
</p>


<p> 
 for the birds have ceased chirping at the break of dawn,
<br>

as footsteps have drowned their song,
<br>

summer, I bid you farewell,
<br>
</p> 


<p> 
for the days have gone short,
<br>

and the nights even shorter,
<br>

summer, I bid you farewell,
<br>
</p> 

<p> 
for the bed has been fixed,
<br>
and the covers now tucked at the sides,
<br>

summer, I bid you farewell,
<br>
</p> 

<p> 
for the door has been opened,
<br>

to unfavorable mornings,
<br>

to restless nights,
<br>

to a year not as long as it should be,
<br>

to decisions I am bound to make,
<br>

and to a future ever uncertain,
<br>
</p> 

summer, 
<br>

farewell.
<br>
