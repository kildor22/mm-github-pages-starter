<p>
I browse through a file filled with old recordings. I tap on the last one saved.
</p>

<p>
"Hey, sweet heart, I love you so much. It's your birthday, and, uhm, you just don't know how grateful I am to have you. I'll always be here. Love you."
</p>

<p>
I hold my finger on the file's icon and press 'delete'.
