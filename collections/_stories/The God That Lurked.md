<p>
The sound of black birds humming to the tone of my heartbeat pierced the air, as feathers of black and blue swirled all around me. 
</p>

<p>
Were there two, three-- no, twelve? Surely, uncountable. All I know for sure was that a cascade of ravens swooped down from the canopies like dark arrows raining down from the heavens above. I couldn't hear my own screaming amidst the sea of caws and talons; fear had taken away the familar sensibilities I confided in.
</p>

<p>
The thick marsh that swallowed my feet did not allow me to falter for I would surely have fallen, if not for the muck that solidified around the leather straps of my boots. But it was not just that-- no, not at all. Only fools would venture into the Outerlands and think that the mud that caked their shoes is culpable for slowing their pace; a rookie mistake. Hesitation is often mistaken for shackles that pin you to your village grounds. I've only managed this far because of the buckler strapped to my left arm and the book of spells clasped to my waist. (EDITED-- because of the chicken in my pocket.)
</p>

<p>
My mental faculties seeped in, returning my eyes, my ears, and my sense of dread-- and to my surprise, I was without a scratch on my guard. I pat my cloak and tunic, brushing residue of faeces dirt. I groped around for injuries, tears and cuts, to which I found none. Fortunate, perhaps. But soon, discovery had made itself evident from the black of the marsh. 
</p>

<p>
The ravens were not swooping in for an attack-- they hurried in a frenzy to *avoid* something.
</p>

<p>
It was a thin, crooked figure that gurgled from the morass. Paddies and brambles entangled themselves in its horns as it rose from the murky waters, twisting its naked body in the slime it seemed to produce from its mouth, baring thorn-like teeth. Its presence, wet and colder than morning dew, but its gaze was red hot, almost so that it seemed to scorch bones and skin, molding them into one. 
</p>

<p>
Taking a step back was not an option-- I was petrified. I wanted to run away. I wanted to go home. 
</p>

<p>
It took a step closer, seemingly impervious to the life-like marsh that devoured all in its wake. 
</p>

<p>
No, stay away! I shout. My buckler tightened around the crook of my wrist. I shielded my face from the beast.
</p>

<p>
*You speak bravely for a boy,* it gurgled a voice that echoed within deep waters.
</p>

<p>
 *You raise your voice to a being of unknown  origin and power. How ignorant.*
</p>

<p>
I am no boy! I am a knight, a title vested in me by the princess of this land, I contest.
</p>

<p>
*A princess?* An ominous cackle rippled through the thick of the woods. *Hnng, your pooh bah are merely figureheads-- village provost that herd the pack for the true rulers-- the ones who shall feast on the very cattle they nurture.*
</p>

<p>
What-- what are you? Only these words escaped the slit in my mouth.
</p>

<p>
*"I am a God, a Divine Being, a Deityâ€¦call me as you wish!"* it hollered, mire spurting between his edged teeth.
</p>

<p>
You're no God. You're not how the stories tell you to b--, it cut me off with a swish of a claw at the waters.
</p>

<p>
*"Foolish human! You are no different from the rest of your kin. By the book, by the book, by the damned book-- that is all I hear. You engorge on fairytales and hearsay, engraving metals and stones with the words of other men. Yet, in the midst of a true God, you reject what your eyes cannot digest. Books are written by men, not graced by the hand of the divine.*
</p>

<p>
I felt my grip tighten on the buckler instinctively, as I stand agape before the God That Lurked. Plumes of steam covered the sparse hair that streamed from its head, down to the shoulders, as water boiled around its facade.
</p>

<p>
"*The Gods you seek rest not on paper, but on the very land you step on, the grass you trample; the dirt you bury. To the misery of the good folk, they scramble on their knees to plead and bow down. Little do they know that Gods do not hear prayers, they answer to action."*
</p>

<p>
"*And now, you come to the Outerlands, and what for? Salvation? Riches? Power? You reach out to The Land Time Forgot, Gods amok and peppered across biomes, for whose sake?"*
</p>

<p>
I could not answer. What did I leave for? My mother's prayers, my father's grievance-- for whom?
</p>

<p>
*"Listen, boy,"* it trudged across the water towards me.
</p>

<p>
*"Naive and ignorant as you are. Born among people who believe that prayers mean even an iota of sincerity-- raised in the furled pages of a book unacknowledged by any immortal-- tell me, do you revere the book or its message? Is it the idea of a God that scares you, or the presence of some sort of promised 'kingdom' hidden in the fine print?"*
</p>

<p>
A shadow loomed over me. The shadow of God.
</p>

<p>
"*Goodness is not bestowed in the book, child. Not within the words nor pages. It is in those who choose to believe. A faith so misplaced."*
</p>

<p>
On His foot sat the world. His shadow, large and endless, before mine. With a swirl of his claw in the water, the whirlpool swallowed everything before me-- and I soon followed.
