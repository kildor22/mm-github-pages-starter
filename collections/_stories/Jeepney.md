<p>
The moment I saw her at the jeepney stop...I knew she wasn't my type.
</p>

<p>
She had bumped into me, soaked from hair to flats and reeking of rain water. Droplets dripped from the hem of her red petticoat, creating a puddle that encroached around her.
</p>

<p>
I would have paid her no mind, had I not been wearing my favorite shirt. First, it was the trains breaking down, forcing me to "queue" with the maelstrom of morning commuters; now, my torso was drenched, with the acrid scent of rain and pollutants stuck to me like a turd clinging onto a sole. 
</p>

<p>
To make matters worse, *she* was the one who seemed startled. I knew this, not from the expression she wore on her face (underneath a wet mass of tangled hair) but because she proceeded to assault me with a hail of punches. Shielding myself from the barrage, I tucked my head behind my forearms, dodging the first blow, and then the next, and then -- kapow! A fist broke through my guard, staggering me backwards.  Before I knew it, I was swept off my feet, slipping on moist concrete. Thankfully, a fat old lady cushioned my fall.
</p>

<p>
After being body slammed by a grandma, the girl helped me up to my feet.
</p>

<p>
Oh. It was *her*. The girl from the review center; the one I was bound for that morning.
</p>

<p>
Sheepishly, she rubbed the back of her head, laughing to damper my piercing stare. She apologized to me, explaining that she swung her fists out of impulse, being easy to scare.
</p>

<p>
And though I was soaked all over, with my favorite shirt dirty in all places, I still couldn't help laughing with her. All it took was the feel of her palm in mine as we shook hands, resetting our mornings forever.
</p>

<p>
It was a first out of many at that very jeepney stop.
</p>

<p>
Since then, every morning, I would meet with her under the jeepney shed, battling the frenzy of commuters clambering for a ride to God-knows-where. At times, when the flow of traffic was slow, we'd sit on the bench, eyeing the crudely drawn artwork on passing jeepneys. 
</p>

<p>
A hundred walks to the jeepney stop later, seeing her had become a morning staple, like eating breakfast; one that I absolutely couldn't go through the day without. Before her, my mornings were like a bowl of oatmeal without hot water or a breakfast of bacon without the eggs.
</p>

<p>
She was the fun I found in pushing my way through a sea of people packing themselves into a nine-seater jeepney -- a happiness I didn't know existed. 
</p>

<p>
Since then, I had not stepped into the morning train.
</p>

<p>
And perhaps, among the crowd of white-collar workers, where she sat with a new friend criticizing jeepney paint jobs, she found a peculiar joy too. If not for the way she smiled, I would have wondered why she had stopped taking the train as well.
</p>

<p>
It became apparent that our jeepney rides were not just jeepney rides, because somewhere down the road, our morning trips were supplemented with evening trips, bound for a shared place we called 'home'. I had moved in with her, for I had fallen deeply in love with the girl at the jeepney stop. 
</p>

<p>
And in turn, she had fallen in love with me -- the guy who fell on a fat lady at the jeepney stop.
</p>

<p>
She was not my type, but love had worked its ways into the crevices of my heart. It told me that happiness was knocking at the other side of the door, and all I needed was to step out and greet her in the morning, where I'd find her longing stare right by the shed. There she stood, grinning from cheek to cheek, waiting for a breakfast that was heavier than any other -- my warm embrace.
</p>


<p>
It's funny to think, because now I realize that she was not the reason I left the train station --
</p>

<p>
she was the reason I never came back.
</p>

<p>
And so, I would spend the rest of my days at that jeepney stop, no longer for the commute, but for her laughter -- one that not even the bustling traffic could ever drown out.
