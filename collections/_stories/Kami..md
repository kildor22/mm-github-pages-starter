<p>
A man has only twenty-four hours to live.
</p>

<p>
He sits on a ledge, peering over the depths below. A flock of birds pass him by, heading towards the top of Tokyo Tower to perch.
</p>

<p>
No one knows who this man is. All that is known of him is that one day, he appeared on the roof of the tallest building in the city, and decided to watch over the world in his silk red tie and navy blue suit. They call him 'Kami' -- God. On his pallid face are watchful eyes that open up like voids hungry for detail. Kami is the overseer of life and death, of merriment and discord, who sits on a precipice where his own existence is trifling. With his back hunched and shoulders slacked, he traces his pupils on the city below, like a pencil tip lining the page of a blinking coloring book, watching people fritter their lives away. 
</p>

<p>
His face is a stolid stencil of a man, with flat lines and edges running over his cheeks, jowls; around his eyes, under his brows, and even the curve of his lips. His hair barely scrapes the ears that listen to the wildfire across the cityscape -- the bustling sounds of traffic and the uniform tapping of white-collar workers on concrete pavements. These noises die down with the sun, and are replaced by the dulcet greetings of an ocean breeze, or perhaps, the yawning of a sleeping city. 
</p>

<p>
And the people from below pass him  daily without a moment's notice, save for a few glances. Down below, it is difficult to notice the facade of a man atop Toranomon Hills without stopping to think. To a commoner, it would seem that a large speck of dust had somehow stuck to its edifice. Upon closer inspection, they would see a man, motionless and apathetic to the rumbling beneath his feet. 
</p>

<p>
They ironically call him Kami -- a nickname that mocks a man who presumably thinks himself higher than the rest of society. He must be suicidal, the passers-by guffaw and walk away. Little do they know that he has only twenty-four hours left to live, and he chose to expend the remnants of his time watching the world. 
</p>

<p>
How did it turn this way, he asks himself.  He grips the middle of his silk tie and tugs lightly, wishing to tighten it around his neck so that the phantoms of the past would let him rest. Regrets abound in his mind, especially the recreations of opportunities he could have taken but did not. His mind is a lone track, with memories of a failed marriage running laps around it. Nearing the finish line is the thought of Saki, his ex-wife, who divorced him because they could not bear a child. 
</p>

<p>
Not because either of them was infertile, but because he did not want to.
</p>

<p>
Images of her smile tug at him from the inside, and no matter how desperately he tries to claw at his flesh, the thoughts are impalpable. She is not for him to keep anymore. Faintly, he hears her voice calling out to him in the wind, beckoning to release himself from the gutted carcass of hopes and dreams which keeps him prisoner. 
</p>

<p>
Weakly, he reaches for the gust of wind, palms parallel to a city of flashing lights. There it is, he sees it -- visions of a wedding gown and a clean silk suit, garlands of pink and white roses, pews of supportive relatives he has never met, cheering and whistling along to the tolls that echo at the belfry -- and it is so close, merely a leap away. He tips over the ledge, both hands reaching out to the world.
</p>

<p>
And over a slowing cascade of lights, his eyes finally widen as the voices are drowned out.
</p>

<p>
 Everything seems large. 
</p>

<p>
The electronic billboards, office buildings, and traffic lights whirl in a sea of color, as the sounds turn mute and motions of all that live decelerate.
</p>

<p>
Among the swirl of colors is the image he sought to grasp. What is it that compelled him so? He parts the clouds to reveal a wedding scene again, though this time, the pews are facing him. And down the aisle, a little girl approaches, bearing two rings. Her face is cherubic, with telltale signs of joy running over her plump cheeks and button nose, creating small hills underneath her chin and around the curls of her lips. He sees the glint in her eyes.
</p>

<p>
Ah, so it is her -- his biggest regret.
</p>

<p>
 Not her, no, but the future he threw away. The future that never will be.
</p>

<p>
And as he falls, 250 meters down, he closes his eyes and succumbs to the jaws of the world. 
</p>

<p>
Then, by the end of the twenty fourth hour, there is nothing but regret.
</p>
