  The evening sky was lit ablaze by multi-color incandescent bulbs. Streaks of yellow light traced the horizon like a child's coloring book, flashing their hues as if to let the world know, "We're open and we're ready for ya!". You had to give it to the carnival master -- their annual fests at the pier never fail to stick out like a bon vivant clown's thumb.
 </p>


<p>
 Lining the docks were red and white tents, all connected by hemp rope and the smile of every clerk who would entice passers-by. Amid the ringing arcade machines, clinking bottles and the laughter of carnival-goers, she dragged me by the hand in silent bliss, looking at every stall, every lit tent sign with absolute wide-eyed wonder. Never had I seen her so happy. If a sudden power-outage were to hit the carnival, there would be no difference for her smile would light up the night all the same. 
 </p>
 
 
<p>
 <em> Come one, come all! Try your luck at the Bottle Drop! Make all seven bottles tumble and get a large prize! </em>
 </p>

<p>
  Hearing that turned her flat-lined, cherry-lipsticked lips into a smile that begged for an oversized turtle, hanging at the very back of a dusty carnival tent.
I conceded, but not before letting out a sigh. 
 </p>

<p>
  One, please. The clerk in an oversized top hat received the beaten up twenty pesos that had been stuck at the pit of my corduroy pockets. I could have sworn Manuel L. Quezon shed a tear as he was stuffed down another. I was handed three baseballs--three chances to fail. Now, I know why ol' Manny was crying. Not for himself but for me.
 </p>

<p>
  Preparing to fire, I gripped the ammunition tightly; its white leather shell burning my palm. She gave me a small poke as if to say, "I'm cheering you on, no pressure. But I *really* want that turtle." I closed my eyes and let my arm do its job.
 </p>

<p>
Thwip! 
 </p>

<p>
<em>Ooh, that's strike one.</em> The clerk had a grin on his face, pencil-stache twitching.
I'll show him.
 </p>

<p>
I grabbed a second ball and returned fire.
 </p>

<p>
Fhwoop!
 </p>

<p>
<em>Yikes, three out of seven bottles, pal. Come on, impress the lass!</em>
 </p>

<p>
At this point, I was gritting my teeth, refraining from baring them at the pencil-stached clown who was revelling at my incompetence. Before raising my arm to throw the third ball at him, she tugged at my sleeve. Her face puckered, losing that shimmer she had on a while ago. My heart sank. 
 </p>

<p>
  Twisting my head forward, I take another look at the tower of aluminum cans before me. Recall those memories of Junior Major League Baseball-- in retrospect, I was never really good, pitcher or batter. Though one thing was for sure: I ran like hell.
 </p>
 
<p>
  My eyes were on target, dead set on ruining the foundations of that tower. With one final burst, I catapulted the ball at the ivory tower's last standing defense. I closed my eyes.
 </p>

<p>
  Clink!
 </p>

<p>
 <em>  Ooh, 6 out of 7 bottles, mister. Don't fret, because you've won the medium prize. </em>
 </p>

<p>
  I peered through the slits of my eyelids and saw a fuzzy cushion of green and yellow being held by what looked like the blurry silhouette of a short-haired, seventeen-year-old girl with a grin plastered on her face.
 </p>

  We took the bridge on the way home. Fewer cars drove at night, so it was safer.
 </p>

<p>
 <em> Sorry about the prize. I uh, kinda flopped on that one, </em>I apologized, scratching the back of my head. 
 </p>

<p>
 <em> No worries. I love it.</em>
 </p>

<p>
  <em>You do?</em>
 </p>
 
 <p>
  <em>Yeah. What should we name him?</em>
 </p>

<p>
  <em> I dunno.  </em>I started blushing, hands buried deep in the pockets of my corduroy pants. My hands get all sweaty when my heart races.
 </p>

<p>
 <em> I think we should name him after you,</em> said she.
 </p>

<p>
  <em> Why? </em>
 </p>

<p>
  <em> Because he's a little guy, like you. He seems tough and hard working. Sure, he's small, but he'll always try, you know? He reminds me so much of you. </em>
 </p>

<p>
<em> 
  You don't care if I fail?</em>
 </p>

<p>
  <em> No. </em>
 </p>

<p>
  It took me long to realize that we had stopped at the peak of the bridge. Had it not been for her kissing me, I would have thought we were still moving.
 </p>

<p>
  I'd wanna stay. Just a while more.
 </p>
