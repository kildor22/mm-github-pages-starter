"Don't lose hope," said a lone comment, swimming idly in a vast sea of white pixels. 
</p>

<p>
It couldn't be - - of course, it couldn't! It was the end of the world, when all had crumbled and civilization was no more than a midden of ash. And yet, after all these years, someone had reached out to me, extending a digital hand from my computer screen and waiting for a response. At the corner of my eye, I spotted a bright red notification on the mail icon -- an embolded twenty two, denoting the number of comments that awaited me.
</p>

<p>
I scrolled through all of my videos.
</p>

<p>
"Day at the beach alone. Posted June 19, 20xx."
</p>

<p>
 One comment: "Don't lose hope."
</p>

<p>
It was the same commenter, presumably. He had no true name, save for a usertag comprised of special characters and numbers. His profile was blank, enshrouding himself in mystery.
</p>

<p>
"Looking at the grass. Posted June 21, 20xx."
</p>

<p>
 One comment: "Don't lose hope."
</p>

<p>
It was my inexpressive no-name pen-pal again. This time, his name was another permutation of numbers and charcters.
</p>

<p>
"Trying to read books again. Posted July 03, 20xx." 
</p>

<p>
One comment: "Don't lose hope."
</p>

<p>
Same comment by the same person, probably.
</p>


<p>
"My birthday! Posted July 17, 20xx." 
</p>

<p>
"Don't lose hope."
</p>


<p>
"Crying. Posted August 03, 20xx."
</p>

<p>
"Don't lose hope."
</p>


<p>
"Can't remember anything. Losing memories. Posted September 21, 20xx."
</p>

<p>
"Don't lose hope."
</p>


<p>
And then finally, my second-last video.
</p>


<p>
"Losing hope. Posted October 23, 20xx."
</p>

<p>
And there it was, the same comment; the inescapable motif that ingrained itself in my head like a firebrand.
</p>


<p>
"Don't lose hope."
</p>

<p>
I have become very forgetful. 
</p>

<p>
My mind had dulled and rusted, as its cogs and wheels were in desperate need of connection -- human connection. Every day was a stranger that I would wake up to, greeting him as if it was our first meeting. And then, once all is done for the day, when I have finished looking at the skies longing for a sign -- a spaceship, message, anything remotely human -- I would bid the evening good bye and shut my eyes.
</p>

<p>
Then I would do it all again in the morning, unwary of yesterday. I would still know who I am, but my most recent memories would escape me. Maybe that's why I started the whole vlogging thing in the first place.
</p>

<p>
I don't know when the memory resets started or why they do. The radiation, maybe? Was it the fallout finally creeping into my skin and chewing my brain from inside-out? If so, it was just about time. There is nothing left for me here but the messages.
</p>

<p>
Were they left by people who came before? Were they trying to tell me something to save my life? It had to be, and they were telling me to pay it forward.
</p>

<p>
I created a new account, with a username similar to the rest of the comments.
</p>

<p>
On my latest video, I wrote, "Don't lose hope."
</p>


<p>
That should be more than enough. 
</p>

<p>
I logged off and called it a day. Closing my eyes, I massaged my eyelids to assuage the burn that seared my retinas. 
</p>


<p>
Soon, I drifted off to sleep.
