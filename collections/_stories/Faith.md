<p>
  On the outskirts of Wardenfell, a lone cottage stood in the middle of the crimson and emerald rolling fields. It seemed to stand peacefully against the zephyrs that blew on wheat and barley grass, making their movements sound like whispers to nobody in particular; to nobody in the middle of nowhere. Except, perhaps, to the boy who sat and listened atop a hill beside the cottage-- who, with eyes closed, listened intently to the sussurous breathing of the trees. There, he listened to the rustling of the leaves and the moaning of the trees as the wind blew life into them. 
 </p>
 
  <p>
He sat and listened as the world spoke.
 </p>
 
  <p>
  Across him, over to the fields, was the figure of a man under a rattan hat, tugging at the collar of his blue tunic that was dark with sweat. He had been tilling the soil with a hoe and burying new seeds. The permafrost had just recently melted over, and it was finally time to greet the year anew. The man stopped to catch a few breaths and looked over at the boy, peering under the brim of his hat as he gripped his waist. He decided to drop the hoe, and trudged his way through the barley towards the child.
 </p>

 <p>
"Hey, kid," the man's shadow loomed over the boy who by now had drifted off. His eyes fluttered open, widening in surprise at the sight of the man.
 </p>
 
  <p>
 "Oh, Uncle Winston!" He sat up, brushing thin strands of grass off his face, "I was just, uh, sitting down."
 </p>
 
  <p>
  "Ye, sure you were. Mind if I, er, join ya?"
 </p>
 
  <p>
  The boy shook his head.
 </p>
 
  <p>
  "Scooch over then."
  </p>
 
  <p>
  Winston plopped himself beside his nephew, groaning and cursing about the pain in his back as he sat.
  </p>
 
  <p>
  There was an awkward silence between the two, almost as if the man had sat with him to listen to the wind. Hoping to break it, the boy asked his uncle, "How's the business? Have the beers been selling?"
  </p>
 
  <p>
  Winston looked grim, adjusting the brim of his hat so that his face would be covered in shadow. 
 </p>
   
   <p>
  "Naye, not since the war. Rarely there been any vagrants or soldiers coming by to drink in fear of the ban," he stopped to pick a thread of barley in his coat pocket to chew. "People 'ave been too afraid to come out nowadays. Bad times for business, bad times indeed."
 </p>
 
  <p>
  The boy looked down, regretted asking his uncle. He was no older than fifteen, yet he felt he had to know beyond his years. The curb of the holy wars was near, and the church will not be ceasing its conquest any time soon. Rations were low, and bread was hard to come by-- it was only a matter of time before they resorted to eating horses. God knows they would rather starve.
 </p>
  
   <p>
  "Why the grim look, boy?" Winston asked. The barley he was chewing was running thin.
  </p>
 
  <p>
  The boy hesitated to speak, twisting his shirt and tugging at the grass. He tried not to say anything brash, but the words spilled out of him.
 </p>
 
  <p>
  "Uncle," his voice trembled, "why do people have to be so cruel?"
 </p>
 
  <p>
  The strand of barley had wisped away from Winston's mouth, now agape, as he was too stunned to search for the right words. Strife in the kingdom had taken a toll on him, though it had not crossed his mind that the boy felt it as well.
 </p>
 
  <p>
   "Mom, dad, they burned down in Sorschenheim, burned to ashes," said the boy, biting his lip. "They were killed even if they did nothing wrong-- just because they did not believe..." 
 </p>
 
  <p>
  "Son," Winston uttered as he grabbed the boy's right hand, pulling it away from his nephew's torso as it started to dig deep. The boy brushed the tears off with his sleeve.
 </p>
 
 
 <p>
  "People believe in many things. They be believin' in anythin' that'll make 'em feel better, make 'em seem like better people," Winston said. "They only ever care about what they think is right."
 </p>
 
  <p>
  "They say that believing makes you good, right?"
 </p>
 
  <p>
  "Aye, but that's where they're wrong. A man is only ever good once he acts beyond his beliefs -- the test of a man's heart is when the need to throw away his belief arises," Winston shuts his eyes and sighs. "Only when he throws 'em away to do the greater good."
 </p>
 
  <p>
  "Have you ever told anyone this before?"
 </p>
 
  <p>
  "Aye."
 </p>
 
  <p>
  "What happened?"
  </p>
 
  <p>
  "They didn't listen."
 </p>
 
 
 <p>
  Silence struck once more. The peaceful buzzing in the trees started to erupt into loud, thundering noises. Winston and his nephew stood up, realizing it was not the rustling of the leaves, but the sound of a thousand armored men marching into the opposite field. Banners of red and white waved among the fields of barley, as the crops were trampled and flattened by the advancing battalion.
 </p>
 
 
 <p>
  "Uncle?" The boy grabbed Winston's sleeve.
 </p>
 
 
 <p>
  "It's time," Winston heaved a breath as he pulled himself up. 
 </p>
 
 
 <p>
  It was now a man and a boy who stood over the hill, overlooking a field of soldiers clad in armor.
 </p>
 
  <p>
  The grass Winston twisted between his fingers slipped loose, forever gone to the wind.
 </p>
