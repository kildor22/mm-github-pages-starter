  Dawn was seeping in, waiting patiently to puncture the darkness that blanketed the night sky. It knew it would still have to wait —though not for long— for the break of day was merely hours away. 
 </p>
 
  <p>
  Yet here he was, looking through the screen of his phone, deluding himself of a virtual world more awake than he was; the boy paid no mind to his weary eyes. Situations such as these would entail the complete neglect of nightly rituals, as ofttimes, bad habits would replace those rituals themselves. 
 </p>

  Before he would leave himself vulnerable to the embrace of slumber, his mother would sternly scold him as he would always forget to brush his teeth. Now, his mother was no longer there, but she had branded this concept in his mind long before her departure. He scrambled out of bed to abide by the warning.
 </p>
 
  <p>
  The aluminum doorknob fit snugly at the nook of his palm, as it had always been— familiar and cold. Turning it would lead to a narrow hallway, also cold and familiar, though too cramped for a boy of his width to pass through without toppling the stacks of old shoe boxes and forgotten novelties that lined the wall to his right. To his left, an old wooden railing met the edges of an old wooden staircase that descended to the living room. Before skewing his body to shuffle through the pathway, the boy muttered,
 </p>

 <p>
Nothing is there, <br>

Nothing is there, <br>

Nothing is there, <br>
 </p>
  
 <p>
  and looked back at his empty bedroom. He found it as dark as he had left it with the lights closed, and as messy as it had always been. 
 </p>

 <p>
  Steps creaked under his weight as he placed one foot after the other. Left, right. Left, right. Left, right— precariously descending into the enveloping blackness of the living room.
 </p>
 
  <p>
 But no matter how hard he tried and no matter how light he stepped, they would groan under his weight, almost sounding delighted at his presence. They let their chatter be known as they whispered softly under his feet, though their intentions were unclear. Before making the last step, he whispered to himself,
 </p>

 <p>
Nothing is there, <br>

Nothing is there, <br>

Nothing is there. <br>
 </p>
 
 
 
 <p>
  Turning to look gave him relief as he was met with his uncle's cabinet, where the old loon kept his assortment of suits and business apparel. How oddly it stood, though, he thought. 
 </p>
 
  <p>
  The boy didn't bother turning on the lights to the living room. After all, what was there to be afraid of? 
  </p>
 
  <p>
  Instead, he headed straight for the toilet, a stall wide enough for only one person to stay in, and flicked the switch. A crude glow caressed the melting walls of the bathroom, the paint peeling from age. He squeezed a speck of toothpaste onto the worn fibers of his toothbrush. For some reason, he found himself brushing in a rush, his hand was unconsciously picking up the pace as if he had to get away from something. Something was nagging at him— something that did not feel right. He froze, after stooping to spit into the washbasin, mid-way through the dip of his torso. 
 </p>
 
  <p>
  Nothing is there, <br>

  Nothing is there, <br>

  Nothing is there, <br>
 </p>
 
  <p>
the inevitable chant rang in his head.
 </p>
 
  <p>
  Emotions started pouring in, syncing themselves with the rushing of the water from the tap. The mirror was a window to his fears and he did not want to look. God knows what he would see. 
 </p>
 
  <p>
  Braving the ambivalence, he rose slowly, mindful of the thumping in his chest. He finally leveled the mirror, only to find a familiar face blink back at him. Realizing that this was his alone, he let out a nervous laugh that echoed in the walls. He closed the tap, shut off the lights, and did not look back.
 </p>
 
  <p>
  The darkness started crawling on his skin like a frigid chill gnawing at his limbs and extremities—he did not want to look back. With haste, he made his way up the creaking steps as the moisture on the soles of his feet stuck to the wooden boards. Every step was a scream.
 </p>
 
  <p>
  Do not look back. <br>

  Do not look back. <br>

  Do not look back. <br>
 </p>
 
  <p>
    He shuffled through the pathway carefully, in fear of the columns of forgotten belongings collapsing onto him. Once he reached the door, he halted to catch his breath. He heaved, once, twice, thrice. The beating of his chest started ringing in his ears. Cold sweat seeped through the back of his shirt. He cocked his head, turning slowly like a clockwork doll to look behind him, and returned to face the door. And as he grabbed the knob, he uttered,
 </p>
 
 

 <p>
  Something is there, <br>

  something is there,  <br> 

  something is there. <br>
