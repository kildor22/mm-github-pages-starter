<p>
She approached me in her wedding dress, smiling as she stooped to the level of my eyes. She was as enchanting as ever.
</p>

<p>
"I'm getting married today," said she. She donned a white wedding gown, her hair tied in a bun supported by the veil. Bangs to the side, you could see the gleam in her eyes -- the same as ever; returning to an old friend from another time, another place. In her hands, she carried a bouquet. In mine, I carried my heart, beating rapidly.
</p>

<p>
"Are you getting married to me?" I asked her. Tears welled up on her eyelids.
</p>

<p>
I held my breath. Here I was, sitting at the spot where we first met -- in front of the school where I would wait patiently for a driver who was always late. And every after school, she would keep me in her company. Waiting with me. Laughing with me.
</p>

<p>
And now, my breath is held in place, almost as if it is stuck in time. She was the sound of cars driving past, of raucous laughter amid the bustling traffic; she was the sound of my heartbeat as it skipped along the pavement, listening to the rhythm of her feet tapping on concrete. She was nothing short of a miracle. 
</p>

<p>
"-No, I'm not," said she, "I'm marrying someone better."
</p>

<p>
I cried.
</p>

<p>
"I'm happy for you," said I.
</p>

<p>
"I thought I'd let you know," said she.
</p>

<p>
"Yeah." 
</p>

<p>
I didn't know what else to say.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you for everything," she cupped my hands in hers and held it to her heart. And for the first in a long time, we were beating at once.
</p>


<p>
Behind her, the portal whizzed, closing in on itself. Someone called out to her.
</p>

<p>
"Love, come back! We're running out of time!"
</p>

<p>
"I'll be there!" She responded.
</p>

<p>
Her eyes met mine, cheeks rosy from the stroke of her tears.
</p>

<p>
"Gotta run, 'ol chum," she smiled at me one last time.
</p>

<p>
Her wedding dress dragged by the hem of her skirt as she ran, despite tugging at it from her hips. Her heels were as pure as her soul, clacking on the concrete as she ran for the opening of the portal. She looked back, curling the edges of her lips.
</p>

<p>
 She was truly happy. 
</p>

<p>
  She hopped into the portal and disappeared along with it. And just before it closed, I caught a glimpse of the future. Her groom waved at me. 
</p>

<p>
  For a moment, it was as if I had peered into a mirror.
