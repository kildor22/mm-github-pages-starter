It gets lonely down here, really. You remember when you were a kid and everyone wanted to ride a rocketship? Well, I was one of those kids. I doodled 'em in the margins of my notebooks, made 'em out of sticks in the backyard, turned 'em into science fair projects. I wanted to explore the _beyond_ —the universe that's out of our reach. 

But it gets lonely there, I find out. Sitting in this space station erected on who-knows-which-planet-by-now with only the beeping of machines to keep me company...not exactly the action-packed space adventure child me had imagined.

This ditch is probably the *last* place I would want to be stuck in the vast expanse of this plane-- literally _anywhere_ except Planet Wanarayes (Wanareyes, why the hell do they even call it that? Says there on the sign).

No other soul has left marks on the dunes of this space rock. In fact, if you consider the galaxy as a city, this freakin' planet would win first place in the "Milky Way's Ghost Town" competition. Nothing-- na da. Zilch. Just orange sand that stretches as far as the binoculars attached to my space suit can see.

Nothing but this rusted cannister of _Mars Power Oil_, an old planet rover named Porter (the old bucket o' bolts), and this darned radio that won't work no matter ho-

Holy shit. Is that music? Chopin's Nocturne?


Instinctively, I hold the radio towards my face until my nose is practically touching the cold metal. The music—it's Chopin, it must be!—transports me to another world entirely. A familiar one, that of fuzzy blankets and hot cocoa and a woman's slow humming voice as piano melodies fill the room.


I brush the cold, rust-eaten grills of the radio against my face. Hello! Hello! My helmets muffle my shouts. Can anyone get me off this stinking planet, please? I plead to the unwelcoming, blinking eyes of the device.
I stare at it for a second.

Blank.

Just a piano melody.

The highs and lows of the notes seem to encompass the planet in a warm, soporific glow. 

I miss you, I whisper into the grill. Talk to me, please.


//"Talk to me, please." Tears start to accompany the melody with their pitter-patter beat, playing against the glass shield of his helmet.//




As suddenly as it started, the music began to fade until there was only static. 

"Please." My voice cracks, but I hear no response. I clutch the device against my chest as I try to control my breathing. 

_What did they tell me before I got on that spacecraft?_

I can't. My memory is failing me. How long have I been here? What day is it? In a place where night is eternal and communication is non-existent, I am trapped. No, this isn't what I wanted. This isn't what my elementary rocketship prototypes were for. 

_Well? What did I tell you? This is your doing. You should have stayed._

I should have stayed.

_This is the real world._



"W-what?"

The music spurred into static, and then faded into a hum that stirred Wanareyes' amber dunes--

for a second.

_I told you, this is the real world._

Porter zoomed beside me, snuggling in what little space was left open by my arm. 

"What the hell are you saying?"

_You've never been here before. You were brought here._

His antennae bounced, left to right, left to right, like a metronome on overdrive.

"By who?"

_By her._

"Who?"

_The Pianist in the radio._


I stare, utterly confused, at the device in my hands. It retains its silence.

"The pianist...?" I scoff at the idea. I glance at the rover skeptically and wonder if it's defected.

Suddenly, I hear the whirring of the radio once more. I nearly drop it to sand in shock.

_Free me._

"What?" I yell through my helmet. 

_Please._

Static.

_We were not meant to be here._ The static in the radio spoke.

 _Do you not remember me?_

"Who are you?"

I peer into the grills once more. Just a hodgepodge of wires slapped onto a green chipboard-- a mix of blue, red, and yellow zips against a green background.

_We were together, once,_ she continued, _before everything turned... gray. Dreary. Barren._

I snap a glance at Porter. He whirrs back.

_We were not meant to be here. //You// were not meant to be here._

_One day, your rocket just tore the sky open, like a metal present wrapped in flames, being hurled from above. 

You crashed beside this very space station. I freed you from the vices of your ship, and opened the doors of my home to you.

But you forget. Quickly.

Moons pass the space station like comets hurtling for the stars, and not a day goes by without you reliving the first day of your arrival.

You forget. Quickly._

I stare intently at the device in my hands, eaten by rust, smoldered by dust and lost in time.


_Now, you must remember. Either return from whence you came, or make yourself open to my abode as it has welcomed you, and soaked you in its orange dunes.

Wherever this radio is, it will always be where your heart should remain. Never forget. 


And only then shall I be set free.

Never forget.

Please.
_

The radio sputters the static, and swallows it once more.

_Voice recording over. Repeat?_

I click the green, triangular button on its head.

It's Chopin.




I'm home.
