<p>
"Hey, do you ever wonder what happened to that rover?" She asked, while tracing invisible heart shapes with her finger on my chest.
</p>

<p>
We were lying in bed on a lazy Monday morning. Sunlight seeped through the windows, providing a natural spotlight for the particles of dust dancing on yhe hardwood floor. Beyond the window, the streets were starting to liven up with the faint sound of cars coming and going through the avenue. Morning was the sound of the mailman's bicycle creaking with every pedal, and there it was, stopping at the sound our mailbox groaning open on its rusted hinges. He rang his bicycle bell thrice to signal his stopping by, and the creaking of the wheels faded into the distance.
</p>

<p>
I thought about her question, trying to recall any previous mentions of a rover. She hated how easily I forget.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you mean *that* rover?" I said, masking my uncertainty.
</p>

<p>
"Yeah, that rover," she said.
</p>

<p>
Her head was lying on my chest so I could not see her face, but I knew she had raised an eyebrow.
</p>

<p>
"What's with the rover?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, his name is Galileo -- or was. He was a probe sent by NASA to explore the massive space giant, Jupiter. They wanted hm to retrieve samples of space rock and collect data," she said. Her index finger was now making large, interweaving twirls on my chest. 
</p>

<p>
"Oh, how did it go?" 
</p>

<p>
"Well, he's dead."
</p>

<p>
Her words were followed by a few seconds of silence, coaxing a reaction out of me. The timing was impeccable and delivery deliberate, but I was unfazed. 
</p>

<p>
She continued, dismissing my stoicism.
</p>

<p>
"Well, as Galileo made his descent to the soupy, thick layer of gas, he was swept away by Jupiter's torrential winds and was presumably destroyed," she said. For a second there, she seemed sincerely sad for the loss of this robot's ephemeral life.
</p>

<p>
"Well, that sucks. Suppose it just wasn't meant to be, huh?" I said.
</p>

<p>
"Not really," she said, shaking her head slightly, "he's probably still kicking. It was probably just the communication systems that were damaged upon impact."
</p>

<p>
"You optimistic?"
</p>

<p>
Her fingertip was now gently poking invisible holes in me.
</p>

<p>
"I'd like to think that somewhere, out there, the probe is still buzzing and searching for shelter. Poor bucket o' bolts, though. He's stranded on a planet millions of miles away, while people celebrate their birthdays and blow out candles like there isn't some robot in space longing for home."
</p>

<p>
She slammed her fist on my chest, surprising me with a blow that knocked the wind out of me.
</p>

<p>
"Well, it's nice to think, yeah." I rubbed my chest with my right hand. That hurt a bit.
</p>

<p>
"You clinging onto that hope?" I continued.
</p>

<p>
"Yeah, I like that."
</p>

<p>
"Even if you don't see it?"
</p>

<p>
"Yeah."
</p>

<p>
She ceased tracing a starmap with my chest hair and got up from the bed. She yawned and stretched, extending her arms upward and arching her back.
</p>

<p>
"Speaking of hope, maybe you'll gain some to get out of bed, huh?" She joked.
</p>


<p>
"Five more minutes, please." I buried my face in the warm side of the pillow.
</p>

<p>
I did not mind spending my mornings like this.
