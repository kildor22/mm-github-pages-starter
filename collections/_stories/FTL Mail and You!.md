<p>
"Do you have it yet?" said Lark the postman, crossing his arms as he sat upright on his LeviBike. The anti-gravity vehicle hovered steadily over the canyon, bobbing him up and down like a fishbob in uniform. Despite the frown plastered on his face, it was difficult to take him seriously.
</p>

<p>
He was not happy making a delivery at 0300 hours, especially when my space shuttle was floating somewhere above *Valles Marineris*. 
</p>

<p>
It was not really a big deal -- only that it was Mars' *largest* canyon. 
</p>

<p>
The sky was transitioning from a quiet dusk to a simmering dawn tinged with a cool blue. Light from one of Mars' two moons painted the jagged outlines of mountains with the same hue.
</p>

<p>
The azure auroras glowed and died in the distance, gently flickering on the black coat of space. From afar, they looked like blue flames dancing smoothly on a dark marble floor. 
Some of the locals called it "The Breath of Mars", and it was a marvel to behold.
</p>

<p>
Though the black and blue sky was reminiscent of a low flame on a cooking stove, the surrounding air was frigid and dry. We humans had to wear spacesuits with state-of-the-art heating tech just to keep us from freezing in contact with  the atmosphere.
</p>

<p>
"Are you gonna buy it or not?" Lark snapped. Apparently, I had been staring into space, drowning out everything he said in the last minute.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, uh -- yeah, yeah, just one sec," I said, feeling for the five astrodollar bill in my pocket. It felt unusually devoid today.
</p>

<p>
"Please tell me you have it," Lark said, pinching the bridge of his nose.
</p>

<p>
"Of course I have it!"
</p>

<p>
"Then where is it?"
</p>

<p>
"Just wait." 
</p>

<p>
I frisked my body in hopes of finding a bump in the pockets of my shorts and sleeping robe.
</p>

<p>
Lark, now expecting nothing from me, turned to his right and watched the auroras float hazily, arms still crossed on his chest. For a moment, his eyebrows slacked and the lines of his face drew a melancholic expression.
</p>

<p>
"It looks beautiful, huh?" He said, sighing.
</p>

<p>
At this point, I had given up feeling around for signs of redemption and joined his gaze.
</p>

<p>
"Yeah, it is," I said. The flaps of my sleeping robe flapped gently in the passing zephyr. Temperatures were starting to sink and not even a robe on top of a layer of advanced space tech could shield me from the bitter jaws of space.
<p>

<p>
"One last view before I leave for good," said Lark, "and damn, if it isn't breath-taking."
</p>

<p>
"Wait, what? You're leaving?" His words startled me. I could not help shaking my head. "But dude, you can't! And even if you did, why and -- where? How?"
</p>

<p>
"Whaddya mean I can't?" He groaned, belly bouncing as he adjusted himself on  his seat. "I've seen shmucks like you in the course of an eon of my life as a postman, can't spend the remaining smidges of whuddever runs through this body of junk with ya."
</p>

<p>
"And besides, it's not like you can pay me tonight, so I might as well just be fired."
</p>

<p>
Lark was right, he was getting on in age. He was no human, but his kind showed the same signs of aging as we did.  His blue face was starting to wrinkle, with visible droops of skin around his eyes and smooth plump neck. Liver spots peppered his cheeks like dark flat craters on a crinkling planetary surface. His laugh lines were becoming more pronounced, and the moustache-like tendrils on his upper-lip had specks of white growing in between.
</p>

<p>
Bob's Faster-Than-Light Mail Services co. (TM) was established in 5001, smack dab in the middle of a crater on the lonely outskirts of Mars. Founder Bob Vergiroz was a mere deckhand serving in an infamous warship. He was hauling crates to be sorted into the ship's musty hull, one morning, when it occurred to him that he could start a business on his own. Certainly, being your own boss was better than being paid off the books, he thought.
</p>

<p>
Knowing that he would not be relieved of his duty, young Bob waited for an opportune moment, hiding in a hollow barrel while the crew retreated to their bed chambers. At the crack of dawn, when the boosters of the ship hummed low, Bob skirted through columns of crates, slipped through grates and ducked security lights, only to be caught by a warden who was tasked to parole the ship's hallways in the early morning.
</p>

<p>
His name was Lark, the Captain's neophyte. They had taken him in after finding him marooned on an exoplanet. Since then, he had been scrubbing floors and shining boots, taking familiarity to the soles of the men who would kick him around.
</p>

<p>
Together, they jumped ship and never looked back. 
</p>

<p>
Despite not knowing where they were, they took the plunge anyway, deciding that any life would be better than bondage. 
</p>

<p>
  And so, they built the very first branch of  *Bob's FTL Mail Services co.* on the very soil they landed on; taking refuge in an abandoned one-storey fuel station. The walls that were crawling with grime and extraterrestrial lichen sequestered them from a life they once knew.
</p>

"You can't just quit, Lark," I said. "You're the only postman I'm actually amicable with."
</p>

<p>
"Look, kid, I get it. Without me, you wouldn't have had the chance to not pay for parcels with impunity," Lark said, pointing his index finger downward. "But the company doesn't need me anymore. It's run by other pricks now."
</p>

<p>
"They're corporates in sleek suits with slicked-back tendrils, while I'm just a rotting co-founder who's wasting whatever is left of his life as a damned postman," Lark said. He poked his chest with his index finger repeatedly. "For a  company I'm supposed to own -- or *co-own*."
</p>

<p>
"What happened?" I said.
</p>

<p>
"He died."
</p>

<p>
An abrupt silence sliced through the valley below.
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry to hear that."
</p>

<p>
Lark sighed. For a brief moment, his eyes traced the jagged outlines of mountains in the distance, looking crestfallen.
</p>

<p>
"Nah, don't mind it, kid," he said.
</p>

<p>
"What are you going to do when you leave?" I asked him.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I dunno. I'll return to our old headquarters, maybe. Reminisce and all that crap," Lark said, chuckling at the thought. He slapped his fat thigh.
</p>

<p>
"You two must have been close, huh?"
</p>

<p>
"Yep, well, he meant the world to me."
</p>

<p>
For the first time, Lark looked me in the eyes with a heartwarming smile.
</p>

<p>
"It was nice knowing ya, kid," he said, revving his motorbike and waving a hand in mid-air.
</p>

<p>
Regaining my train of thought, I stuffed my hands in every pockets currently on me, looking for a sign, a clue, or at least a dollar.
</p>

<p>
And there it was, dwelling in the belly of my right short pocket. I fished it out.
</p>

<p>
"Wait, Lark, before you leave," I said. 
He turned to face me, looking over his shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you for your service."
</p>

<p>
With a smile, Lark received the blue bill and stuffed it in his worn orange fanny pack. He punched a few buttons on his logging machine to confirm that I had paid, and it whirred for a few minutes before screeching a receipt out. He slapped it on my waiting palm.
</p>

<p>
For the last time, Lark waved me farewell, and drove his LeviBike in the direction of the rising sun.
</p>

<p> 
In a few moments, his figure minimized into a speck, before disappearing into the mountains beyond.
