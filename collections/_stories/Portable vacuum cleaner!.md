<p>
"Portable vacuum cleaner!" 
</p>

<p>
The man in the red vest shouts through his microphone. His sales pitch reverbrates through the cold air from the minuscule speaker weakly attached to the sleeve of his belt. 
</p>

<p>
"Bumili na po kayo! Promo na 50% off para sa pasko!" 
</p>

<p>
He attempts to smile wryly, with the crack in his voice barely worth a notice by the passers-by. He puts his whole weight over the table-- arrayed with the mechanical, plastic parts of the vacuum cleaner he is desperately trying to sell-- and puts his sweaty palm over a wrinkled forehead. For a moment, if not for the raucous swarms of mall shoppers inching through item displays and tired eyes, the man was falling into a pit of slumber. His back was bent and his uniform crudely out of shape, his stick-like forearms were sprawled carelessly on the red tabletop, ready to break under the weight of his shoulders burdened by a machine small enough to be passable as a toy.
</p>

<p>
He lets out another call for attention but retreats soon after. He has seen it-- no, heard it, more than enough to know that apathy speaks louder than words and there is no means to go beyond that. He is only a man in a red vest, after all. Just a salesman whose survival for the winter depends on a price-cut vacuum cleaner. Nothing more.
